  "player_speech_text": "Yeah, it's been exciting. Of course, um you always kind of uh had this uh this date mark on my calendar for a while. Uh you know, the comment is uh become a little bit of a tradition for uh you know, math eligible players. So, it's Yeah. Yeah, I mean this is uh probably the biggest mediest SC I've ever done. So um you know, world juniors included. So uh this has been a big turnout and um I a pretty big deal. So um it's kind of the last step towards that. So, um, it's great to see the the people come out. And Conor, it's one thing watch. Sorry, the draft, do you feel like you are the best player in this draft class? Uh, that's not up for me to decide. Um, you know, I think a lot of people do a lot of talking and and uh, you know, they'll judge uh for their own eyes. Um, you know, I believe in my abilities and that's the main thing. But I feel I'm the best player in the draft. Um, I'm answer from Jack, but um, we'll see. Did the year? Did you watch it? No, not too much. Um, obviously you just got to worry about yourself and and make sure um, you know, you're ready to go each and every night. So, um, I thought I did a pretty good job of, uh, you know, not letting it get to me. Do you welcome the comparisons to Jack, though? You welcome years to come. Yeah, I think uh, we'll at least. Um, you know, it's uh been is beginning to change? I mean, this is this scrum, this is probably not going to be the last time you have a scrum of next couple of weeks. Uh, yeah. Um, course. Uh, been dealing with it for a little bit now. And, um, it's something I like doing. It's fun to to do this. And um you know obviously uh I like to play hockey more than than this stuff and um you know it's it's a good problem know at all together this Yeah, I got to know him a little bit better. Um you know it's been interesting obviously uh you've been linked together for so long now. You start to feel like uh you know him and um it was good to finally meet him and get to know him a little bit this combine for you? I mean, if if it hard to read your reaction, so I figured I just ask you about it. I don't know if it was like shock. Yeah, it was more like it was Have you been asked about that? Like it was uh once or twice. twice I've been asked that. So, um yeah, it was more just shock than anything. Uh you know, kind of for a couple years now. It's it's been, you know, you're expecting one thing, you're told one in a whole instant it's not the case. You know what I mean? So, um it was uh an exciting day. Um I was more just shocked than I think. Have you accepted your land? You know, likely land. We'll good. Okay. Um Okay. Um yeah. Um yeah, I mean uh there's nothing to accept. If it's Edmonton, it's great. I mean, I'll be so happy if it's Edmonton. If it's not, then it'll be great as well. I mean, it doesn't really matter. year spent a lot of time around Aaron you learn from that experience and how I obviously am very good friends with Aaron and and both Sams and um it was a lot of fun for me just to kind of follow um of course kind of asked them about their experience and they said obviously come draft time it uh it ramps up a bit and you know they're more than right. So He's unbelievable. His hockey IQ is off the charts. Um, you know, what he's able to do in in terms of finding people with the puck and um, you know, making great passes. Um, you know, it's it's so fun to watch. Um, um, I' I often times find myself just uh, you know, kind of watching them when I'm on the bench and, you know, a guy like that you can always uh, you know, learn some stuff off of. interview process? Uh, all very straightforward. Nothing too uh too Uh, I'm not sure if you you look forward to the the tests, but I mean it's it's it's going to be fun. It's going to be exciting. And um, you know, it's always a new challenge. So, uh, it'll be grateful for that that it's kind of coming to an end here? Uh no. It's something that you kind of want to save or um you only go through the draft process once. Um it's something that uh time now and um you know it's it's going to be obviously so happy when you get drafted, but um you know that's kind of there's no uh no more junior life or or anything like that if I'm lucky enough to to move on.",

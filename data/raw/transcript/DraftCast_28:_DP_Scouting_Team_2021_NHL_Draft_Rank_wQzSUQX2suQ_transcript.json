taller than 510. yeah every everyone owen power 77 the only difference is i have hair oh you know what you know what i'm done with this i'm gone bye guys you're listening to dauber's draft cast with tony ferrari and the dauber prospect scouting team powered by instat hockey [Music] all right welcome to this week's episode of dauber's draft cast as always i'm tony ferrari your favorite ball draft analyst and the managing engineer of dropper prospects this week we have a very special episode for you after missing last week what i've done is record the scouting meeting from dr prospect scouting team we had it on february 28th um i've edited down a little bit cut out some of the stuff that doesn't necessarily need to be out there in public and stuff but uh the meat of the conversation's here um we've got almost three hours or more than three hours of coverage here so um it was a great conversation with all the scouts and i i it was awesome to have it's always so informative and so great to listen to all these guys talking and get some credit for their their hard works they've been doing a ton of hard work throughout the year so i want to give big i want to give a big shout out to the team uh on today's episode you'll hear sammy turpak uh dylan griffin e tu silton alexa potak mikael holm uh merrick novotny our new crossover european scout caitlyn berry braden olufsen jacob barker aj gudyro nick richard and unfortunately we also did have three members of the team that weren't able to make the meeting and danny tiffany jameson iwasiak and claire mcmanus i'm sorry if i butchered any of your last names i'm a terrible human being and i'm terrible with pronunciation but without further ado let's get to the meeting it was a ton of fun so i hope you enjoy welcome to the first draft we are not the first draft meeting but the mid-season draft meeting uh for the year because it's uh it's been a weird year and this is the what everyone seemed to deem as the mid-season point so it's been a weird year but um we're gonna look at the top 15s that we all did it last time and that kind of gives us a good base for where we're gonna go on that top uh top end of the draft so um names like fabian lucelle willie macklin yes for wall street matthew veneers luke hughes even um they've all been up there for first overall so anyone have a first stab at who they'd like to go up there because uh like i said this is this is more about your guys the team rankings and everything because my rankings went out and everyone knows i'm a fabian lucell guy so um yeah anyone have a first first stab at who they think should go first overall and maybe a little bit of a reason why i still think veneers that i haven't really changed from what i said when we did our top 15s i think like when you kind of compare or kind of weigh a player's floor against their ceiling i don't think anyone kind of has the combination of potential as well as floor that veneers has his game just seems like it's ready to translate right away i think he's not far from being an effective play driving center in the nhl no i totally agree with you there like veneers is the guy that if i'm an nhl team that's probably the guy i go with me being not in nhl team i'm more than willing to take the chance in safe having myself because it's not my job on the line but veneers really is like just such a well-rounded player um anyone else have any anyone else have any suggestions before i mute myself in the middle of a sentence again who ended up being our uh our consensus out of those top 15s tony do you remember uh the consensual yeah i think the consensus ended up being tied between eckland and lucelle i think veneers was like one short um and then jesper wallace that was in there a couple times as well but i think it was a tie between uh eckland and lucelle and like i said veneers was right there i could have easily chosen veneers myself too so um yeah it to me it's those three guys um yes for or yes for wall street as much as i love him i want him first overall um the reality is like no team is gonna take a goalie first overall because they're all cowards and like it's just what it is right maybe detroit gets up there and takes them but uh i think it's between those three guys so um mikhail maybe you talk about willie macklin i know you and i just talked to him so maybe we're a little bit biased in this regard yeah we just had a nice conversation with him uh i think when talking about veneers i think eklund is pretty similar in that he has uh like comparing floor to the ceiling they're pretty similar so um i i'm very torn between miscellaneous right now they're both like the the five we have at the top can of course all be number one picks but yeah i don't know where i leaned i think they leaned a little bit towards eccles now compared to before because i think he stepped up his game the last couple of weeks after having a quite a rough patch with the covid and appendix surgery and stuff like that now he's back on track and he's scoring goals and he's pretty much a standout player constantly in the shl which is quite impressive when he's just 18 years old yeah i think like even me like i'm the biggest fabulous doll guy around like i love the kid but the gap is closing for me a lot and eckland is right there now and like is i had like they were closed all the time but man like ecklund's really stepped up his game the last couple weeks like you said and i mean i wouldn't be opposed to putting my number one um veneers as well fabian lucelle to me like i i had him at number one on my rankings but that he is the the home run swing of the three i think so like realistically i wouldn't be shocked if he's the guy that falls in this group and i think i know myself aj uh punch the people we talked to and stuff we all kind of go yeah you know what like lucelle's sick but like i could see him falling to 12 on draft day just because some teams are crazy and they they don't see the production from him necessarily that they see from a guy like william eckland you know i think maybe a bit more of a projection than yeah like maybe there's a little bit more development left to be had with laselle and rounding out the rest of his game whereas eklund has kind of already got all those elements down where he's well-rounded and a dual threat in the offensive end he's kind of i think his vision and processing might be a little more advanced than lasalle's at this point but the the pace that lazell does everything with the speed the way he winds up and just carves through the neutral zone when he gets the puck it's hard to ignore that if he's also impressive with the cell that he he he's so flexible like if he's put on the first line he plays like a first-line wing winger he carries the pocky enters christian stone he tries to find his teammates and then when he's a fourth line winger he just grinds trying to win like four checks but down d and just get him like just do playing like a fourth line winner and i think that's very impressive for a 17 year old guy to just be able to adjust in the way he in whatever way he wants to like is he's needed i think that's one of the most impressive things with yourself as well yeah one thing that doesn't get talked about enough with lasalle i know a lot of us have talked about it but like the way he hounds pucks and uses his speed to not only generate offense but get it back for his team uh it's something that's underrated i think yeah i like his forecheck a lot like i've seen him he's so aggressive when he four checks and uh like even if he uh over commits he's got the speed to get back and get back into the play and maybe turn it around he's just exciting to watch like i really like him he's my number one as well i'm definitely on team tony with that but yeah uh i mean he could go within the top five for me but i'd really be pushing for him at one but i'm a fan of upside guys so joe roland i had this discussion there uh before well probably two three weeks ago and uh he abandoned us [Laughter] yeah open opening uh fresh wounds but uh in any case yeah no the one the one thing that he and i really appreciated about uh william macklin something that he opened my eyes to is the ability he has to make a decision you know within a split second of having the puck on his stick uh the puck can be gone and and it's in the perfect place it's not the most obvious place but it's it's the place where it needs to be and uh if if you just just watch for that in any kind of viewing of william macklin like that's i mean that's i think uh probably one of his most uh intriguing uh characteristics all right so i think we're all kind of set on those three guys as those top guys unless anyone has anyone else that like like to maybe push for number one um i'm more than willing to listen obviously um but yeah we've got to figure out what order those three guys are in here yeah i was just going to say so let's just let's just do a quick uh show of hands because that might be the easiest way to do it with these three guys so um if you think fabian lucelle goes number one put your hand up all right that's two so three oh look at that three i thought that was more than i thought um all right how about with uh william eckland one two three all right in matthew veneers yeah and then matthew benares wins it and like i said i think he's the guy that was gonna end up winning it because he really he's like the safest of the three right um so let's lock him as anna's are number one and we're off to the races finally and then and now unsurprisingly william eklund and fabian lucelle tied in this again so uh let's go based on those two guys uh william eckland for second ah fabulous all for a second why do we have to okay william becklin won william macklin won by one hand um i'm fine with fabian lasalle being at number three because like i said um it's one of those uh he's in the right day and it could be either one of those guys right yeah right like i'm trying to stay unbiased to how much i enjoyed talking to william eklund about half an hour ago so i i i'm sticking with my fabulous cell got but yeah like those those three in my opinion have separated themselves at the top of the class and and then i think we get to who i would at least have at number four um i don't know if anyone else is against it or for it but yes for wall stead the the ridiculously talented technically skilled goaltender um does anyone have any opposition to him being four because i know he was in the top five on almost every list that we did so any opposition to him at four i've got no opposition to wall stead at four he's my number five but uh the guy i've got at number four i feel like i'm probably a little bit higher on than the rest of the group here so i i've definitely got no problem with wall stead at number four all right beautiful i'll just lock that in then so we can get that and uh this is already going faster than last time so this is beautiful um all right now now we kind of get to that big group of defensemen this is uh this is the range that i think everyone's kind of debating between so let's quickly talk about everybody um who wants us to maybe touch on owen power because he's been so fun to watch at times and then so frustrating to watch at others it's it's a bit of a an up and down viewing with him i think i can chat about him a bit um just because i'm a little bit higher on him than a lot of a lot of people i talk to again i'm not high on him but i like there's definitely a lot of uh issues you see but for me i i see a very mobile tall defenseman that skates really really well going forward and has a lot of offensive upside and when you kind of look at those tools like and he's very very raw like you look at the flaws and it's like he gets pushed off the puck all the time in the defensive zone his decision-making at times is so so he sometimes kind of just gets like a tunnel vision like he'll get the puck and start skating and then like everyone no one else matters on the ice it's just him going forward uh so the flaws are there and i know the comparisons are being made too was it tyler myers was that the comparison and i i think he i think it's a little unfair for us to label him at that right now because there is still a ton of room for him to grow as a player and when i look at like his ceiling i think this guy could be an absolute stud at the next level i now i would probably look at brian clark or luke hughes before him but no no doubt if i'm an nhl team i would be pretty excited to work with him with my development team and see like kind of what kind of brain he has and if he's able to process the game at a higher level and just hasn't to this point but if he if he's able to the the raw tools are there if he's willing to get the commitment in off the ice and on the ice so that's that's all in power i i think you make a really good point there jacob about him being so raw that uh you know regardless i mean everybody in the draft is raw to some extent and he just has so much um so much gift in terms of his skating in terms of his size that if you're right if you can work with that and uh and and mold that that raw ability into uh the ultimate player he he has more going for him physically than so many other players kind of in this range well the one thing i always find myself asking or the one thing i always find that i'm asking myself when it comes to powers if he wasn't six foot six like does his skill set stand out does that ceiling stand out the way that it does just from looking at his measurables i i don't know i haven't really seen it when i'm watching power like i just think that the decision making leaves a lot to be desired um he does get pushed off the puck a lot for a guy of that size and that just makes me more curious about how much of a factor that's going to be for him at the next level yeah i think when i was doing my rankings and i kind of like i was sitting there and i think he was one of the last blurbs i actually did when i was like writing everything and it felt weird to have like the spot at eight not written while everything else was and i'm like i don't know what to write about him because i don't know what it was and then my wife's a big fan of final destination movies and those cheesy crappy movies and so i was like you know what i was watching it with her and i'm like oh my god this is watching owen power like it could be so good like he's a roller coaster right like you get on the road coaster you're excited you're happy like this is fun like when he's going he's got the puck on his stick like this this is a player that you really value like his straight line speed his puck rushing ability is like i don't think there's a defenseman in this class that has the same level of ability to generate the power that he does but then there's so many things i question about whether like he gets himself into the corner and you're like okay well what are you gonna do from here and he doesn't know what to do from there um i think there's so much more development on the mental side of the game for him because that raw package like like you guys have all said it's ridiculous like six foot six six of five whatever you want to give him 215 um he's a special package but man like there's so much outside of puck rushing and outside of um his length that really go into his evaluation because like you guys said defensive only gets knocked off here and there um if i find he's always leaning offensive like defensively in terms of like he's outstretched to get the puck he's not really kind of gapping up he's using the fact that he is a massive human being to reach out and try to knock the puck away but once he starts leaning forward that defendant or that puck carrier makes a move to the outside foot and and open power isn't able to kind of jump back in that way so um for me he's the him and edmondson are probably the guys that are are the lower out of this group of defensemen um mikhail you want to talk about simone evans in a bit because he's he's a bit of the same thing but not with the same flaws i don't think no they have some similarities in their flaws that you can see but i edison is a it's a little bit calmer i think on the top like he can handle a little bit pressure a little bit more than the power does um i think also edginson is a better defensive reading power right now the way anderson can close gaps and stuff is really really good i think that's one of his biggest strengths especially the defensive side um but yeah edwardson is uh someone i've been pretty low on like before but then after like in the new year in 2021 basically i've come to grow him a little bit better i'm going to like him a little bit better because i think he's shown that he's developing that he's like he's starting to show off some but he's working on the stuff that he needs to work on so you know but he's quite not there yet i think he's yeah somewhere around this range would be perfectly fine for him and yeah he could also be he's one of those these the players in this trap that has a high ceiling because he can be uh such a phenomenal fun player in the nhl if he hits everything correctly but yeah yeah edmonton's my top defenseman that's the guy that i have ahead of wall stead at number four i know that's probably a lot higher than most people have him and there are similar things that he has to work out like power has but i think the things that he has to work on are more easily rectified than what power has to adjust to and the way that edmondson has handled himself even though his limited action at the shl level i think he really acquitted himself well there like he's a he's a dynamic attacker like he can block a guy from the blue line and and beat two layers like in it in the blink of an eye and get into space to fire a shot or dish to his teammate like the the skating and size combination and the offensive skill i think like the ceiling for edmonson is so so high but he's a guy that you've got to trust your development staff if if you're bringing him in yeah what i have a little bit of issue with him is that his passing is very much hit and miss sometimes that he he throws pucks away a lot and uh sometimes he sometimes he finds uh he finds the correct pass or he finds the path no one's seen but a lot of times it's just like throwing the pumpkin open along the boards and down to icing and then they does that three times in a row and you're like what the hell are you doing but but then the next shift you take the puck steps behind the net and then you just get through the entire up position team you know so it's it's it's very up and down with him sometimes yeah yeah i was going to say i think the the thing with steven edmondson is is the consistency isn't there at all and and i think we're seeing him playing in the austen skin and he's seemed to acclimate himself there i think that's probably the best spot for him right now um well i think he he did flash a lot of things at the shl level um you noticed at times he did seem overwhelmed a bit at times and um he's clearly clearly too good for the junior level so i i think he's in a good spot now um i've liked him a lot since he's been at the elves fencing level so he's definitely a guy that i i'm definitely including in this range um caitlyn maybe maybe you can talk a little bit about brent clark too because he's another guy that like when he first went over to slovakia i was like watching games and i'm like what what does he do what are you doing man but like the last like after like probably five or six games he like something's flicked in his head and he just started going and he's been a lot better since then yeah he seemed to take a little bit of time to adapt i don't know whether that was like bigger ice or anything um but yeah uh clark he's one of those really fun defensemen to watch you know he has that uh offensive ability he has the ability to sort of drive the play from the back end um obviously his iq is is really really high super good passing i also think his uh defensive game is underrated i think all of his offensive talents get really touted um but i think he's really really good um defending the rush he's he's always in the right place his his gap control is great in that um yeah i think he's better on his own end than people kind of often give him credit for yeah i know you're a big fan as well jacob [Music] yeah no i again the same kind of thing when he first went over and we started watching games you're like oh oh no like this is not the same i i think i messaged you i said this is not the same brand clark that we watched last year he his because last year the one thing i had always loved about him is his just offensive and defensive instincts were so good and he could always just kind of he knew what was happening next he was always putting himself in the right position to drive the play forward and then cut out plays in transition for the other team um and then when he first went over it was it looked like a mess and you had no clue what it was but then uh he i i forgive it it was him it might have been often we were talking about but uh just making the point that there's a lot of factors going into like for when you first go over there you've got the big ice you're playing against men the quality of the league is so so like some teams are good some teams are more challenging it's a different style of play overall so when you're when you're doing that it's it takes some time to get going and then once he did get going he has kind of returned to his form and i think that the tools that he brings uh definitely have the like are translatable to the nhl like his instincts and close he can move the puck while while pressured so i'm not really worried about his game translating at all i think it's he's more of this he's one of the more safe defensemen in this range i think he he will be in the top four at the next level for sure and can run a power play and kind of generate offense for uh for whatever team drafts them so i'd i'd probably have them first in this group right here and then maybe luke hughes after but i know we're gonna talk about the rest but that's that's just me for that now sammy he's been in your neck of the woods so i know you have an opinion about him first couple of games just rough i he wasn't like like he looked he looked like deer in the headlights just didn't know his positioning didn't know the timing didn't know anything but then he figured it out slowly and he's from what i've seen even in ohl last year he's that drysdale type he's more two-way guy than people give him credit for he has um obviously his positioning i think uh nick will agree with me he needs to be worked on a little bit but uh yeah offensive instincts are incredible with him uh he out of those four guys we have in those in that range five four of them he has probably the best ability to jump on jump up in the rush and uh join the enjoy the forward group and he knows when when to jump and also when not to jump when to just stay back wait for his opportunity on a blue line uh make some play from uh make some play from there and uh yeah i i liked him seen uh ever since he figured the timing out because of the bigger ice the competition uh the physicality as well yeah i was gonna say i think one of the things that i noticed when i had him on for the draft cast and interviewed him and stuff the one thing that he said was it wasn't just about him adjusting to his new teammates it was about his new teammates kind of adjusting to him as well because um he knew that he didn't want to necessarily change his style of play in a massive way because this wasn't a full-time thing this isn't this is the temporary situation for him um so what he said is he's like it got to a point where like they were in meetings and he he was telling guys guys like you can trust me when i have the puck on my stick i'm not gonna turn it over i'm not gonna make some boneheaded play go up the ice i don't need four four people back in the defensive zone supporting me we want to score so let's get that puck up the ice and then him kind of acknowledging that that it wasn't just him that had to adjust it was it's kind of everyone having to adjust to him as well it was something that i found really interesting but like we said we can talk the thing is here with him there aren't many guys in slovakia who play like him yeah the the fastest game they don't they just pass back to the forwards and just hope for the best and uh they i majority of the guys never played with a guy of his offensive ability and sense so it took a little bit of time as well so he's he's definitely right to what he said i think he made a good point there tony like when you're talking about what you spoke with clark about on the game tape thing like when i first started watching him when he went overseas this year i found him really really passive and just kind of like sort of drifting around not really sure of his place or what he's supposed to be doing and he he really like became more assertive in his game and confident as the as time passed and i think when he is playing assertively and trying to take over the game his ceiling is as high as anybody's in this draft class yeah i think i'm not against any of that because i mean the kid his offensive instincts and like we said the defensive game with him i think it is improving and and you've noticed that big time in slovakia's he's willing to kind of engage those bigger players and the the adults right like that's one thing i talk about with them is like you're playing against guys who might have a kid that's only like three or four years younger than you like how like what is that like and and he said it's like it's just a different experience playing against guys that are just so much stronger in general like even though the pace the play isn't the same as even the ohl he said it's that physical element that he didn't have to deal with before that he's had to adjust to as well um but let's get to that last defenseman in this group of four that we kind of have and that's luke hughes um this kid he's got so much talent and skating ability um i i there is a lot of stuff that he has to reign in and kind of work on in that regard but uh i know dylan you're a fan of him so maybe you gonna talk about luke a little bit oh yeah he's uh obviously very young he's very mistake prone but he has so much skill uh his skating ability is great um so he's kind of like sitting down be like hey don't be going so crazy trying to do these flashy plays and calm down make a simple pass because his passing especially has been a problem uh that i've noticed uh just like every game will fire off a pass that just goes nowhere near anybody but uh just kind of calm down figure things out slowly and then his upside is you know it could be all the way up there with the best um but you know compared to someone like clark he's a lot more of a risky pick just because you don't you don't really know how well he'll be able to handle slowing down his play um but if you can just work with that there's definitely so much upside there yeah i think the thing with with luke hughes for me is like i look at all these defensemen and i go who's improved this year and i go oh and power's been what i've expected he's been he's been what he is and simon evanson's been up and down all year and i mean there are plays that look great and plays that don't look great but um brent clark i i found has improved a lot especially defensively but for my money luke hughes has made the most progress in terms of just uh his overall decision making like like dylan said like there's still that pass at almost every game that you go where the hell was that going and it just goes into being an icing or it ends up being a turnover in the neutral zone or something like that but like his ability to to read the play offensively and he's not taking all the chances he was at the start of the year at start of the year it was like he was a fourth forward on the ice board like for most part but um he he's reigned himself in a bit he's kind of made a little bit better decisions and uh defensively he's he's tracking much better there was a point early in the year and last year coming out of his u17 year where i was like man like his defensive play is just not where it needs to be because he he'd be on a guy he'd have good gap and then he just he wouldn't either never pivot or he would pivot way too late and the guys buy him way way easily and it was a concern but he's he's taken a step there so i like luke hughes a lot in this range i think kent johnson probably deserves a little bit of talk here too um the the skill is ridiculous and stuff like that so uh before we move out out of the this group of defensemen kent johnson probably does end up winding somewhere in between these guys um who wants to maybe talk about kent johnson's game and some of the things he does really really well number one jacob yeah yeah i was the one that had him first on my rank and so i could probably try to try to advocate for him a bit i he will not be first on my new rankings but uh i still i still absolutely love him uh he has a ton of offensive upside he has the ability in my in my opinion i i think he has the ability to be one of the most or one of the highest point producers in this draft class and like in terms of upside if he reaches it he can i when i look at like a fantasy draft i would probably be leaning towards ken johnson in my in my first round uh just because the offensive upside's there he's flashy he's incredibly fun to to watch play obviously there are concerns his top speed is not great it's actually worse than not great i think it's he's slow is the is the general consensus he's very slow uh when it comes to that but i i look and he has fantastic stick handling ability his passing is great his shot's fantastic he he has all the tools but then just kind of piecing it all together and the iq is slowly starting to come but it's taken a while uh he's decision making at times is very very bad and he'll he'll try to do something flashy when there's a really easy pass that could generate a scoring chance for michigan uh but the the big thing that i advocated for before uh with him is that he's coming from the bchl which is a league that we we all know he with a guy like him with the skill that he has he could do whatever he wanted in that league and it was never a problem he like there is not a single player in that league that could touch him last year and then kind of translating his game to the ncaa i haven't really seen him falter too much in terms of like do you see the holes in his game but it's not stopping him from producing and that could be he could be the benefactor of playing with maddie veneers that could be a a real thing and like because veneers takes up a lot of attention so that that could be legit but um when i look at what i've like i've seen him improve from dchl the ncaa i haven't really seen his production drop off so until i start to see him like not improve and what he needs to improve i don't think it's fair to just knock him because well he's he played a bad league and now he has some he has some holes and that's that's it like he he's shown improvement in every in every way so far at umish like from his first game to now i've still seen the improvement he's making better decisions he's starting to do less crazy things so as um as a year goes on i'm seeing him get more comfortable and when i look at that i'm okay you went from a really badly to a better league was and is still able to produce and he's still improving his game why wouldn't he be able to kind of do that through the rest of his career and he's still got probably another year or two at umish at least right like he's not coming into the nhl next year for sure so he has at least one more year at michigan before he turns pro which is another full year of ncaa hockey for him to improve and kind of get like learn learn a little bit more about the game how to how to produce in certain scenarios and then another year on the ahl and then he he'll be ready to go in that case so that's that's kind of my outfit like what i'm thinking for kent johnson again i would he's not number one on my list anymore because i realized that that's a bit of a stretch so i i've got them at around four or five on mine uh behind that group of forwards and goalies but um yeah i think you could probably slot them somewhere in between this group of four defensemen like maybe clark and hughes first and then maybe somewhere in that thing with power around that range in edmonton but that's that's my thought about it yeah my question is who do we think is the top defenseman of this group right now because my opinion is probably i i i bounce between clark and hughes every time but i i probably lean brent clark right now even though i know on my last ranking i had luke hughes there but like those two is so razor thin in the the improvement i've seen with clark's defensive game and just his ability to kind of he he was so good at directing traffic even over in slovakia you're constantly seeing his arm up in the air pointing directing guys where they need to go and stuff so um i probably brent clark but anyone else have any other player they want to make a case for at number five maybe i mean i have used second overall but it's just one of those things that's like like who you want there um so i'm not really concerned who goes over who but i mean i'd be pushing for hughes yeah i think like like i said on my ranking when i put them out last week i i had hughes ahead of clark quit five and six um i wouldn't be opposed to putting hughes there if if that's what the group kind of likes better because like i said those two for me are you toss them up in the air and i'll pick out whichever one falls to me right uh anyone have any specific uh favoring there otherwise i think we'll just go with what dylan likes and as much as i just like that fact eileen hughes because he's a bit younger like he's uh right at the end in terms of being eligible so there's he might be behind a little bit in development just because he is a little younger so there's more time we should wait a little more time and see what he can do that's more where eileen yeah i think the the youth factor with hughes like he's what like five or six days from being eligible next year so something like that yeah it's not much like he's a september birthday so it's gonna be one of those things where like yeah like the youth factor does play a factor um five and six hughes and clark any objections to that sweet all right now where do we want to put kent johnson in this group in this next group of three guys because i i probably have kent johnson ahead of the other two um but there's an argument easily for the other way around um uh alexa sorry i have i haven't seen a robot show my head of the johnson on my list as well but i'm not sure anyone else does but i like simulation a lot as a player and i think he's just stepped up and become better and better with this season has come as well because he's playing a lot in the shl but in a smaller role but he's his temple and his speed and his pace has gone up so much since like when i watched him in october when he played in the in the junior league in sweden so i think he he's a very special guy that i said i like a lot around eight so i just wanted to put his name out there alexa what's your take on those swedes there with edmondson and uh robertson yeah so i think edmondson goes ahead of robertson i think that evanston like we said he could go you know he he has a high ceiling but he's got a lot he's got to work on to get there and i think that i think it's kind of a maybe a more aggressive pick than taking robertson because you've really seen how his game has come together this season but i think i would go evanston over robertson all right so if we how about we go like this for for seven to nine we do edmonson power unless anyone has any like does anyone really want power ahead of ed vinson because that's not my opinion but like like i said this is more you guys than me so i'm more if someone really wants power ahead then i'm more than willing to push him there all right cool i have no objection big i have power above and vincent on my personal one but the gap is like literally non-existent between like first and eight overall yeah so whatever the group thinks i would agree with all right yeah i mean i know at least a few of us in this in this group i've had private conversations and power isn't the favorite of many of us so uh what if we went edmondson i don't want to go power johnson um what about like edmondson and then we start talking about robertson with power and johnson because i i think that's probably about where i'd go with the next group of guys and um i really like seymour robertson i know i've been pretty high on them all year even when i did the range for him i put him in the 10 to 20 range but i could easily see him kind of slipping in ahead of a guy like dylan genther who i mean has had a great start to his two game season but some people have wanted to push him into like top fives and stuff and that's crazy after two games um but no seven points i mean i know i know i'm gonna look like an idiot this entire thing's gonna go out and people are gonna be like oh look at that look at that bald idiot they're just freaking talking about dylan genther when he goes first overall in four months from now or something like but uh whatever that's that's what it is but no i i think i think owen power ken johnson seymour robertson uh too ratsu i don't want to forget about him either um uh e2 maybe talk about raw two a little bit because i think he's a guy that i hasn't getting any respect because he did have that terrible start to the year he was left off the world juniors and stuff so uh what's your take on him buddy well yeah he had a really bad start for the season but he's been a lot better now and he's been playing in the second or the third line i've got about with his brother um and they've been really good just no points maybe they have like a couple each but um he's he's looked a lot better now i think his step that he's taken since being left off that world junior team like i i think he was like legitimately pissed off about it and and i don't know if that was the motivation or what it was but since he came back to the uh to the legal level he's been so much better like just um just in terms of everything like yeah like you said he's not really producing a ton but um he is playing against men and he's i mean he played against men last year as well but his he's kind of like maturity to the game like he just kind of puts himself in the right spots offensively he's a wicked wrist shot so um he's the guy i think probably is in this range as well um but who do we want to go with that eight because we've talked about four or five different guys so someone give me a name for eight because if not we're just gonna talk about half a list and uh not making any progress here what did you guys do with um five six seven while i was trying to start up my generator there oh yeah nick nick out here working on generators i was powering up lost power we went uh 567 was hughes clark and edmondson uh now we're kind of debating between power johnson ratou simon robertson as well as in kind in that group so um it's it's a bit of a bit of a mess as most of this draft class is i i like i like seymour robertson here actually tony and uh you would kind of mention i'm a bit of a sleeper in this range but i think uh i think he's kind of a player who might might turn out to be a bit of a coach's dream when he uh when he starts to get get into the pro level i think he uh he executes tactical plays really well he uh he can play in in a system and and doesn't make a whole lot of mistakes and i mean relative to uh what else is available here i think that's i think that's a valuable thing to have yeah i mean i mentioned that he he's got like one of the maybe the best wrist shots in the in the draft it's ridiculous that he scores he scores from the blue line with his wrist shot like just beat he's to go keep it clean and no traffic and stuff it's just he's got a ridiculous shot yeah i think it was in the uh the swedish uh games that they played against each other u18 versus eight and not u19s um he scored a goal where he was kind of like falling down a little bit as he crossed the blue line and just fired it on net and it beat the goalie clean i'm like okay well that's just that's just what happened i guess because his shot is like wicked good so i mean i'm i'm not opposed to putting simone robertson at eight if that's where we want to go i mean there's definitely guys with higher upside available but um yeah he's a bit lower on the list but but i could see the argument for having him in the top 10 for sure but by the same token as putting veneers ahead of eklund and lucell i think uh i think it's a similar argument for for having having uh seymour robertson had a head of like guys like like kent johnson so how about we go simone robertson owen power ken johnson is anyone opposed to that uh kind of order there in the top ten too low for uh that's my one concern too is like i i don't love the idea of ratsu coming out of the top ten so do we push power and johnson down because that's that would be my first inclination power down below rather i think we can we can drop rather out of top then it's it's fine it's not he's not that good every time we do one of these things e2 comes up with one of those and just yeah let's put in the second round there are some concerns we throughout this game in my opinion i mean when he was in his trunks minus two season he was like so much ahead of everyone else and now i just feels like he feels like that he's he's behind everyone else and that's a bit concerning for me so where has the development been these two years and um he's still struggling with his like on the back game like there while while they're playing a uh cycle game in the offensive zone he he isn't really there he's he just goes in front of the net and stands there and i don't really like that i mean he he has pretty good spark skills so i think you should have like more confidence to use them also in legal level so all right i'm i have it set up now where it's it's power johnson wrought to it 9 10 11. um i i this next group is kind of like sure they're they're guys in this draft class i'm not in love with a lot of them um but i do think dylan gentler is probably going to fall too far if we don't put him here mr seven points in two games he's going to show tony wrong and all that stuff but um his biggest issue for me is is the pace of play kind of thing and his skating because he doesn't always move his feet and stuff i mean the last cup i watched the couple games he's played already this year he's looked better he's kind of active and getting going but i do still have a bit of an issue with his pace of play but i i feel like dropping him any further than this would probably be criminal because he he is a really productive player a really smart player um he's got his offensive intelligence should have him around this rage and that's just it right like he's such a smart offensive player that even if he's not playing at pace like he might be one of those guys that legitimately doesn't need to play at the pace of a lot of guys in the nhl he's able to kind of ramp things down himself um like i almost look at him as like a poor man's coal perfetti in that regard like i think perfetti's got a much higher ceiling and overall and everything but a better game in general but um they both kind of have that issue of pace of play like they like to get over the blue line kind of stop analyze things and make a decision from there but like i said his offensive iq and his just his ability to attack is special so i i think 12 is probably good for him and then we get into that group of uh isaac rosen cole stillinger chaz lucious zachary leroux fedorsfechkov uh my boy scott morrow like there's a lot of guys in this range that are kind of um up in the air so who wants to make a pitch for somebody at 13. i'd like to nominate oscar oleson here if we've got simone robertson in the top ten i don't think that you can really justify having olson a whole lot lower than him that's just my opinion i think the the skating ability the the two-way game it's it's easy to kind of project it to the next level i think he does a lot of things that nhl coaches will appreciate i just think he'd be a really valuable middle six kind of transitional guy who doesn't hurt you at the defensive end of the ice either yeah i think one of the really interesting things about olausen was uh at the world juniors he was held without a point and he got pulled from he didn't play i think one one or two of the games for sweden but uh he was still one of the most effective players in the entire tournament in transition so he's a really good player in transition i think he like you said both guns of the ice you can kind of affect things so um i'm not opposed to putting him here uh mikhail what's your take on him yeah i like him a lot uh he he's like he's good at almost everything or like a little bit of everything like he's got he's got nice hands he can like he showed at least in the junior leagues more than maybe in the shl but he's a nice handbag good skater got a decent shot you know and he's he played both both ends pretty well so yeah i like him a lot uh around this area i put him in i think my range was 12 to 20 but yeah i think somewhere around here would be pretty decent for him yeah i'd like to see him come in somewhere in the 13 14 15 16 range on this board i think he's looked really good um on his loan in the offspend skin so far and i think that even when he was still in the shl and getting really inconsistent minutes i think that he still was able to make the most of them and didn't really uh shy away from the adversity he was facing so i think that um yeah i'd like to see him falling around here i think like mikhail said he really can do a lot well all right is there anyone else anyone kind of wants to put above oscar ellos olosen um because i know i know guys that coal cylinder chas lucius have crazy high upsides like they're good goal scorers um isaac rosen's a fun guy but i think realistically he probably gets bumped down even as much as i love the kid but um oscar losing i'm fine with him at 13 unless anyone has any objection to that and wants to maybe put someone else up there first i have cylinder ahead of him uh i saw him his first few uh ushl games uh super skilled uh good shot but uh just thinking the game is such a big issue for him he gets tunnel vision so hard he just wants to do everything himself and then loses the puck doesn't play the defense much at all so uh i think if you're banking on the upside with him you can kind of pump up higher but i mean i'm not super opposed to dropping him because you know he's not really doing that well besides his offensive production really i think for this range i'm concerned by cylinder skating a little bit like i don't know that he has the ability to get himself out of trouble as well as some of the other guys that i mean not only out of trouble i don't know if he has the ability to get to the same kind of spaces in the offensive zone at the next level you can score from this the other spaces that everybody else can't though yeah yeah but you know that that's that's a good point tunic yeah yeah cylinder is a a really good player like it cylinders that guy like if he breaks like i wouldn't be shocked if he gets drafted in that at like 15 or something in in everything goes right he gets a little bit of a step off or step in his skating and he ends up being the best player in this draft class like i think that's a legitimate um a legitimate possibility with him because the offensive skills are so good um i'm concerned about his skating though that is a legitimate thing and i do worry about it but like the offense like i i am uh offense or upside leaning guy so i i generally go with the upside so i'd probably go cylinder ahead about lowest in but um i i can see it either way with those two guys so uh if we want to go uh a low since cylinder 1314 we can kind of look at guys at 15 and go from there just a genuine question here where are we sitting in terms of carson lambos are we kind of letting him drop into like the next tier of defenseman with like spazzle and um and those guys and chica are we gonna because yeah that's i i don't i really have an opinion either way it's i'm cool with whatever but i just want to know where we sit on him because if we want to put him higher then this is probably a decent range for him i want him to be good so bad i like watching him in the like even on my rankings i said it like most players i put where they're playing right now like i put whether they're playing slovakia for clark or slovenia even for paneli for lambos i straight up just didn't even acknowledge the fact that he played over in sweden or never happened never happened i just i i said it right in the in the blurb too i was like notice how i didn't say that he was playing for yip in sweden or finland because it didn't happen like there was just not even the same player over there like it was brent clark in his first three four games in slovakia but every game he was over there it was really confusing to me um i want him to get back to the the whl and just like tear it up because this this is a guy like i pushed for like in her first meeting of the year like i pushed for him right at one and two like i loved this kid's game coming to the whl last year and watching him in in finland this year was just such a head scratcher like i'd say i lost my hair doing it but i don't have any and like it's it was tough like i probably haven't like i had him down at 20 um and even that i felt he was being a little bit optimistic after seeing him play in finland because it was just such a stark contrast like i'm concerned about dropping him too far but i'm concerned about keeping him too high as well at the same time like i think he's probably going to be end up going a little bit further down unless anyone really wants to push for him i've got him outside my top 20 too just barely but yeah so let's get on with guys like chaz lucius who just kind of came back he's doing the dylan gentler thing where he's just producing like crazy in his first few games back and i mean not to the same extent as gunther but um chas lucius xavier borgo zachary leroux fedor svetkov i think somewhat enters the conversation at this point um so who wants to to maybe speak to one of those guys i've got xavier borgo basically tied to uh chaz lucius basically but i would i would put virgo just i mean a hair ahead of him probably i think when we did our top 15s i found out that there was a few others who seemed to be fans of him even more so than i was at the time but um more recently i kind of bumped him even ahead of uh zach laroux so yeah i think borgo is the guy out of the queue that i look at as the top guy right now because um i is i love zachary larue when he's playing his game and he's doing stuff like i don't know if there's a player i like watching more in this draft because like he's a straight-up sometimes like it's just fun to see him like go out there score a goal and then punch a guy in the face in the corner like it's just fun to watch but he gets suspended like every other week it seems at this point and i'm like what are you doing man so it's not even that he's i'm undisciplined in terms of taking penalties and yeah and stuff like that i feel like he's actually just undisciplined in a lot of ways like he uh he's smart enough but he he'll he'll run around and take himself out of position um to make a huge hit i mean and the hits are great but he takes himself out of position by doing so and i knock him to that a little bit but like you say a little just hunt a ton to love about zach theroux but just over the course of the year i've begun to see and appreciate a couple of the things that uh the rest of the guys here and what will be in one of them um do more consistently or yeah i guess more consistently than the rue does yeah i think in this range it might my two guys here would be leroux and or sorry not the borgo and chaz lucius um i i think lucious had a really good start to the like to his little year i know there was a lower body injury there were there was a lot of different reports so i won't get into exactly what it was but um he he's come back he is his skating is still a concern but it does look a little a step ahead of where it was last year um you're more concerned with his skating or less concerned with his skating than you would be with cylinder probably less concerned i think he's smart enough to get to to get to his spots with timing and anticipation better than cylinder i think stillinger's like got the skill level probably on him and i i think despite the fact that i think both of them have excellent excellent shots like some of the best in the draft class i think stillinger probably does have him a little bit beat there too but um i'm more confident in in his in uh chas lucius's game at least being a a second line scorer kind of thing whereas i could see cylinder at some point like like i said i could see him being the best player in the draft class but at the same time i could see him being this guy who's constantly on the third line and almost like a like i don't want to compare him to alex galchenyak but having a career like that where he has a few good seasons and then he can't seem to get his footing anywhere because whatever reason is he going to be able to do enough away from the puck to justify having him in the lineup for his offensive ability i think that's my biggest question still with cylinder and i've got lucious ahead of him because of that yeah like so i'm i'm thinking in this range we probably go or go at 15 or uh we're going 15 lucious at 16. um unless anyone has any uh opposition and wants to get someone else in there uh maybe it's fossils i know sammy you're you're big on zfozel absolutely but i agree with lucious and porgo being ahead of him all right so let's do that especially borgo because to me what i see is perfect complementary player and he doesn't he's not play driver in a sense but he does a lot of things to help the better player on his line produce he's very difficult for for defenders to get a get a beat on it seems like like he he's able to kind of like slither around the offensive zone without anybody really paying much attention to him and then um he just pops up you know in the back door and all of a sudden the puck on his stick and and either he'll shoot it or or he'll you know he'll get the goalie moving back he's never the best guy on his line he never will be but i think he's always would be the second best guy on his line yeah no matter who he plays with yeah i think what i kind of been saying to people when they asked me about borgo is i'm like he's the best second best player on his line in the draft right yeah if he's if he's the second best player on your line that's probably a really good line and i think he's going to be an excellent complimentary player at the next level like i look at him and i'm like man you put him with whoever like you put him with the nhl version of maverick bork and you're gonna get a good offensive player who's putting up numbers um so i'm fine with him at 15. lucious at 16. and then maybe we start to get into the conversation of uh scott morrow who's a crazy gamble i know a lot of people are not as high on him as i am i i'm super high on the kid but um comes into the conversation here um fedors fechkov as well i think is more than valid here uh dylan maybe talk about fedor because i think you and i are both pretty high on him yeah he's uh great defensively that's kind of where he stands up most compared to most of the forwards in this class his positioning is always great he uh gets physical along the boards when he needs to he's not exactly a big guy but he can kind of throw his weight around enough to free up the puck uh and then he in tight situations he almost always manages to get the puck on a stick and control it and leave wherever he is and then in the offensive zone it's uh he's not like super great or anything but he has a nice shot he distributes the puck well he uh he tries a lot uh which being on two terrible toggliati teams uh trying to push offense as dangerously as possible is always positive when you're playing with people who don't know how to or don't want to play hockey but they're just kind of there on the ice to fill space he has to be the one that does stuff and playing in the vhl that's exactly what he's doing but for potential issues with him uh he is in a bad system in russia the sea dogs have his rights and he is under con under contract quote unquote with the with uh toggliati i'm not sure how vhl contracts work i don't know how any russian contracts work it's all confusing over there but i think he's one player that if you can sign him right away and get him straight into the ahl that's probably the best move for you because he's not going to develop much more playing with people who are just there to get the puck to him so he can do all the work yeah i think with fedor it's it's you see the the defensive game you see how smart he is on that end of the ice and um the offensive game you're seeing start to come with with diff just different little smart passes and he's got a decent shot as well so um i think he certainly deserves to be in this conversation uh dylan how high would you kind of have him because i'm almost willing to say i'd put him at 17. um i i debate because i like isaac rosen as well so i might put him ahead but um fedor's right in this range i think yeah i've met 15 to 20 for my my range for him i think 17 is more than perfect for him he's just going to be a really good nhl player yeah i think like the intelligence he shows it in the defensive game he's kind of encouraging for his potential offensively as well just because he does think the game at such a high level he's able to see things developing in the offensive end the same way that he does when he's tracking back and you know working to cover in the defensive zone he's a guy i've got a number 15 on my list just because i think he's a really easy translation to the north american pro game just because of how responsibly he plays without the puck all right so unless there's any objections i think fedor at 17 is where i i'm probably going to land um anyone object to that maybe they want to get larue or i'm not thinking shiver cop because i think dylan and i are both on the train that fedor should be ahead of him um but yeah i think him at 17 is probably where i go as long as everyone's okay with that now let's get into the the zachary larue isaac rosen um brendan othman kind of that debate um i think it's fazel's probably here as well uh yeah svalza is a really good defensive guy i think he plays a good two-way game i worry a little bit about his offensive upside but um in the same vein of fatal or like i think with better teammates around him you might be able to get a little bit more out of him that way uh you know merrick maybe you want to talk about him yeah i would say like he can really surprise everybody because uh he's really dangerous uh i watched him like two days ago when uh he was very dangerous offensively his transition play is amazing and his skating and his vision is like what will make him really good defenseman so yeah i guess like in this draft he can really surprise everybody by being drafted really high or maybe you know i would i was thinking about it like it's maybe similar to ian isaac from the last year that maybe he can be picked in the first round or maybe even in the second round uh i'm not sure about it but as a defenseman i would like uh put him really high in this draft class so his vision instinct transition play and uh that's what makes him really good but i would like to see him uh shooting more that's what i would like to say yeah yeah sammy do you think this is probably about the spot for spazzle yeah i i think so yeah the main offensive guys who i would have hi are already above him so what i would say about swazil lately is that he's more of he's trying more offensive things as a flight he was more of a defensive guy uh earlier in the season but this year he's trying more he's uh more creative in the offensive zone and tries to tries to attack more from the rush which obviously he does that's his best quality moving the bug up the ice from either side because lately he's he's been playing more on the right side than left what i've seen in games so i yeah that's probably the right spot for him around 20 between 15 20. yeah i would maybe just add that uh i guess he is at the the confidence at the world juniors and like i also need to mention that he's been in the top check league since 16 years old and he looks really confident like gay by game so yeah i think maybe that's something we didn't touch on enough maybe at the top of the ranking when we were talking about guys like equine and laselle in comparison to edmondson or even like johnson and veneers compared to power the the adjustment for defenseman moving up levels i think is is more difficult for than it is for most forwards just being able to process the game and the way you know opposing forwards attacking on the rush and things like that everything's just kind of happening a little faster for defenseman so for a guy likes fosil to to be comfortable at the men's level and have so much experience there as a draft eligible i i think that's something that's uh really intriguing it's also huge for oh go for it in terms of development uh playing against the tougher com competition and playing pro leagues with guys who played in nhl like his teammate with peter mueller that teams know that uh guys like that don't grow on trees usually especially defenseman so i just i'm very high on him with also in that in mind yeah and he's also like playing in the club where martinez was playing so i guess like he's getting a good care so maybe yeah he can surprise we will see all right now let's get to some some of the forwards here i think deserve some some love and that's isaac rosen and zachary larue um mikhail and alexa maybe you guys want to touch on rosen and where you guys kind of think about him because for me he's probably falling a little bit too far at this point but i i totally understand why because he's small and he's super skilled and and that's always a concern for nhl teams but uh where do you guys see rosen i think he fits well around this area um i like his of course his offensive skills he's very talented skater is good with his hands but he can uh he can like he controls the puck very well in the offensive zone he's not rushing the puck like rushing a pass or rushing a shot away he can like settle down and carry the puck and try to control the the play a little bit i think he disappears a little bit too much still in in the games like he is not always he's not always there i'm i think he's he's just like a little bit up and down i don't think he's creating that much ear in the shl at this moment but i think he he has certainly the potential to be a very gifted winger in the nhl yeah i think that he's a guy that like you know you need a good development team to really get the most out of him because like mikhail said i've really been noticing even as of late that he disappears he's invisible some of the time on the ice and you just you're watching shifts and he he hasn't touched the puck for four or five straight shifts and you're wondering what's going on i'm a little bit bummed that he didn't get uh loaned out to the office fencing or hockey at on because i think that his ice time's gone way down as of late and i think that he would benefit from that but um yeah i think this is a good range for him but he is you know somewhat of a high risk pick with his size and some of the flaws in his game and braden where do you kind of you have larue in the same range here because i i think with with what he could be at the next level there is something that larue is different than almost anyone else in this draft so um letting him fall too far would be kind of a little bit of a a little bit of a sad thing too so you think that rue should be around here too as well no i agree i think uh with larue you also you're also hedging your bets a little bit right he can whether or not he does uh come in and translate some of that that skill that is in his game the uh you know he's got excellent hands he's got excellent ability to protect the puck in the offensive zone um but but like i say in addition to that you're hedging your bets a little bit because he can he can also slot into a lesser role he might might have an opportunity to develop an approach system you know once he ages out of junior that sort of thing um and and really flourish in in an ahl team ahl team excuse me um or even you know slot in our fourth line and kind of grow his career that way so i think i think you've got options with him for his development that way and then and then obviously the upside as well so i'm thinking with with rosen being a risk and in the rue being a little bit more of a guy that could play on the fourth line if worst case scenario happens right he'll make it um i i got larue at 19 and rosen at 20. any objections to that all right so let's move on to this next group of 50 players that seem to all be in this range roughly and um uh i'm just going to start with scott morrow and plead my case here um because the skating and raw tools of this kid are just ridiculous like he plays at shout out st mary and i've been very on the record in in most years of saying i hate high school hockey and don't draft out of high school hockey because it's not successful in most cases it's it's taking a lottery ticket in in winning another lottery ticket like that's not not the best thing you could do but with morrow the tools are so exceptional like his ability to change direction on his feet is just um i i saw someone post a side by side of of him at the blue line and kale mccarthy blue line and while that's obviously a pretty ridiculous comparison at the end of the day um the skating i think is is roughly the same level like i think that morrow's skating is going to take him far um his offensive tool said his skill is just ridiculous um he's a high school player though so the concerns are very warranted of where he's going to end up um there are some extenuating circumstances i i could get to that um off the show kind of thing and not uh reveal a whole lot there but um he's going to und next year they're a defenseman factory i think scott morrow probably deserves in this range um i know there's a few other people that have seen him so maybe someone else wants to kind of uh give their take on him too because as much as i like him i totally understand him being dropped down into even maybe towards 30. he's that guy where i think whoever ends up picking them especially if it ends up being in this range it's it's like that you know their hands are shaking over the button you know how it's gonna go right but um i got no problem with him being here either no i think the tools are definitely there like you said tony uh the biggest question is again like you said the level of competition and it almost looked like he's not challenged enough at that level most of the time and i'm curious to see [Music] at the ncaa level what he's capable of when there's a maybe a bit more urgency and he has to rely on his instincts a little more and it can't just like co-spy on being exceptionally better than everyone else on the ice um but i would like to throw in chibrikov here if we're going to talk about you know high upside and maybe boom or bust potential i think the the offensive skill of chibrikov and the transition game and stuff like that i i think he warns some discussion in this range too if we're going to be talking about moro yeah i was gonna say dylan maybe touch on that because i know you've seen both those guys so uh maybe touch on chipper cop first though uh yeah so when mikhail and alex were describing isaac rosen i was like are they just talking about chibrikov but in sweden uh he's small he has an issue of inconsistency uh but yeah there's a lot of that skill that you're gonna be seeing on twitter in gift format of him doing a super cool move and it's going to be really really cool on the eyes and then you're going to ignore that he's terrible defensively and that he's not really driving a line um they're just he concerns me because i don't think he realizes how small he is and i feel like he's gonna end up getting injured somehow like this uh he'll go up along the boards in the vhl and he'll just get crushed from behind because there's no way that him being five foot 10 161 is able to handle a hit from a grown man well he's kind of reckless all around i think a little bit yeah there's definitely not a lot like he's precise until he doesn't want to be anymore and then it's all that precision is out the window uh he sees open ice and half the time we'll just go straight towards them and get a shot off other time he'll go to the board and get himself pinned over there and eventually lose the puck because he's not winning board battles um but there's just so much potential and he's a player that you want to be really good but is he going to be uh like a guy that you would be considering like top 20 no not really like with claire's still on the board um just because he's not gonna be driving a line in the nhl he's going to be more of a player going to give the puck he's going to do a cool move and hopefully get the puck to someone else so dylan i know you've seen scott morrow too so would you have morrow ahead of him i have chipper cup ahead um but there's not much gap between them i'm totally for going whichever way uh it's just i guess development uh chipper cubs obviously with ska that's you know best system in russia probably uh moro you know you got him in the uh high school and he's going to college next year i'm assuming yeah yeah uh so i mean it's just kind of flip a coin and pick whoever you want i love this too i'm not uh super convinced either way yeah i think we should talk about othman and lambos and maybe even to amala and shayca here but one last point on morrow i wanted to make is you guys all know i've been very against the draft being moved back i think it's idiotic and and so many other ways but i won't harp on that too much but with scott morrow he's the one player i look at and go if the draft does get moved back he's the guy i want to pay attention to most because you will see him at und next year if that if that is the case and um like i said for most players i think it's pretty stupid to do and stuff like that but with morrow maybe that is a benefit for him if that does happen and and maybe him playing at und next year might even push him towards the top ten like closer to the top ten um at the same time if we're going on the fact that the draft is happening in july like i think the premise that we're kind of using here is and there are concerns there um maybe caitlyn want to touch on brendan othman a bit because he's been a guy that um i've liked and i have him in this range every time i kind of look at my own rankings and stuff like that as well yeah i kind of have them in this range as well although i think i have them second among hr people on my list um so othman he's he's he's one of those scoring guys he um but he's not just that kind of one-dimensional score like his shot i think is one of the best in the class maybe um but he can also score in a lot of different ways his offensive zone vision is super high-end he's really really dangerous when he gets into the offensive zone um he can he can find lanes for himself and passes for others i think his playmaking um was a major thing on flint last year and i think that kind of got underrated in the face of the scoring i think he's really good there um he also he's hard to play against he plays that kind of physical game he four checks hard um he has kind of some potential to be a two-way player if he kind of rounds out his defensive game a little bit and there are like concerns with his skating um i think he's got a lot better acceleration but there's little bits in this game that need to be worked out right now i almost had hoffman in my top 15 um those pieces and i tried really hard to put him there but uh at the end of the day he he just slipped out of it and i i think exactly what you said caitlyn like in terms of his skating there's a little bit of a concern he doesn't have the prettiest stride and he doesn't really have an awesome top speed in transition but um i think he he's a factor in in more than one way he can he can get a little physical he's got really good intuition um and and absolutely has a great shot he scores from i found a lot of low percentage areas where you wouldn't see other guys scoring similar to maybe a coal cylinder but but maybe not quite yeah i know when uh i did the interview with him and jacob joined me for that and we talked about to to othman and the kid was like a hockey junkie i think to this day that that's still the longest one i've done so far and while most of them end up around 20 25 maybe even 30 minutes for a long one uh othman's i had to cut down from an hour to 45 minutes because he just he was just into it like he he loved talking hockey he loved um just kind of talking about the minutia of his game and stuff so um i i think the intelligence that is there with him i i tried to get him in my top 15 too um i toyed with it i put him up i took him out and i i ended up settling with him out of it but um even though i'm talk we talked about scott moore and chipper cobb like i wouldn't be opposed to putting brennan offman ahead of those two guys um uh is there anyone else anyone wants to talk about in this little grouping here or are we good to kind of uh make a couple uh picks for the the rankings here we have a representative for logan stankovin because i feel like joel was like a huge huge stankovin fan and that was yeah i don't know if we i i will say logan stan coven deserves to be in this range um this the knock on him is he small um he's a ton of fun though like this kid is a buzzsaw he he reminds me of uh of tyler tulio from last year who i was super super high on but the skill level is just way higher um i think the shot is ridiculous with this kid like you you don't expect a 5857 kid to have a shot that can beat a goalie from probably outside of the blue line to be completely honest like he's a really offensive player and his motor never stops like i'm a big stan kovan fan he was going to be probably the next name i brought up because i keep trying to push carson lambos down um but yeah i think stan coven if we want to get him in this range either i'm not opposed that in any way shape or form yeah i wasn't saying that he would have to be ahead of any of those three guys but i was just just thinking yeah like he probably does deserve to be in the conversation and maybe just tail tail off on half the blizzard maybe yeah i think the one thing with stan coven is he is small like he's is he's listed at five seven uh or five eight and it's like there's not a ton of uh guys that small at the next level i'm excited for him to get back with the whl um i know the bc division is kind of still up in the air but i i it sounds weird but i'm looking forward to seeing what they list to matt on his height because if he's five nine five ten i think teams look at him a lot differently than they do at five seven five eight um i would have no problem putting him in that group of three especially if i'm willing to take that that risk on morrow um i i think logan stenkov there's as much risk with him because probably less risk because he plays in the whl even if he is small so um what if we kind of went um othman morrow stankovan chibrikov and any objection to that all right so now we get the to the carson lambo samuchuamala um e2 maybe you want to talk about tuamala a little bit because he's a guy that you and i have kind of not necessarily debated on but i think we've both kind of been on the side of he's good but there's there's a lot else there yeah i think his upside is really high um because he uh mikhail told us said that robertson has a really good shot i don't know maybe duamala is better i haven't seen robertson but um he has he's a really really good sniper and he's an excellent skater and i think that his his upside is really high but there's some concerns his defensive effort is really lazy uh but it doesn't really matter i i heard that some some one of the scouts said to me that sebastiano had a really bad defensive effort in his draft here when he was playing in juniors and that's almost like these guys aren't finished products eh yeah i don't i i'm not too concerned about that i think he he's just too good to the junior league but not good enough for legal level maybe he should play in maestis and when he's at his best he just dominates he can you know he can keep the bug like for 30 seconds and then shouldn't score but um yeah he's a bit selfish also now dylan talk about danielle shaika a little bit uh he's super super defensive um the offense isn't all that much there but he's definitely in this range yeah i was about to bring him up uh he's been hovering through all three leagues in russia uh he's gotten quite a few games with chesca and he's looked solid defensively and then there's just um you're wondering how much offense there is and it's like well he can probably just pass the puck in the offensive zone and leave it at that uh he shoots a lot that's always been my concern with him he had a rough world juniors and i think people bumped him down a lot because of that but i think that this team russia system in general was not kinda him um everyone was just spamming point shots on a team and they're all getting blocked and they were giving up scoring chances because of it um but he's a great skater he's solid in transition he's going to get the puck from the defensive zone into the offensive zone somehow he doesn't really play super physically he's more of a i'm gonna get you where i want you and then i'm gonna get my stick in there and i'm gonna get the puck out with my reach uh because my arms are way longer than yours and i'm gonna get the puck um so it's just how much offense is there gonna be because he's definitely a player you can put in the top four in the nhl level and he's gonna be rock solid defensively he's gonna take up a lot of space on the ice it's just where's uh like how much of a black hole is he gonna be offensively and i think if he just develops continuously um his skating is already great his passing is you know fine in the offensive zone could still work on getting a bit more dangerous passes there instead of you know point to point and then risking that past getting intercepted and giving up a breakaway but just working under pressure and just kind of refining everything that he has yeah i don't know if there's another player in this draft class that loves shooting into shin pads more than denil sheikha but yeah we'll get to him maybe um like danielle shaikh is a guy that uh his defensive game is so good like he he might be the most mature defensive player uh on the blue line in this draft so um i had probably put him in this range him to amala um we get the carson lambos as well who i've continuously tried to keep pushing back a little bit but um i have a feeling that caitlyn might like pinelli in this range yeah i was just going to say let's let's get pinelli in there as well and and maybe talk about uh yeah i think pinellas probably the last one in this grouping at least yeah um i would definitely have pinelli in this range for me um it's a kind of razor thin edge between othman and pinelli for me um arthur wins out right now um but pineally is just one of those just versatile guys he's a real jew like dual threat he has that shot um he has great play-making ability that often goes kind of underrated although i don't think that's massively on display in slovenia right now um he has started actually picking up his scoring in slovenia now after struggling a little bit um i wondered initially if it was just because the first game he started really scoring and he got four points was against a junior team but he's he's kept on without scoring now i think he's realizing that if he wants to get things done he can do it himself he's not looking for that pass quite as much anymore um but yeah he's a really really responsible player he plays a kind of complete 200-foot game although there are some kind of things in the defensive zone and i think he needs to work out um but yeah he he's a a huge threat when he comes into the offensive zone in kitchener last year whenever he had the puck on a stick in the offensive zone you knew something was going to happen he was either going to make great pass or he was going to score and that's pretty much what i've seen from him yeah i think my thing with pinelli is like you see the mind is there like there's no doubt that he's able to think the game and kind of diagnose what's going on in front of him um my biggest thing with pinelli is when he's moving his feet he's a good skater he's not a great skater but he's a good skater he just doesn't like moving his feet all the time and that's a concern like there's so many times where i'm like if if he takes two steps he could get to that loose puck or if he takes two steps he's able to make that play defensively like caitlyn said where like he's almost there as the as a complete 200 foot player um in this range though like looking at the guys coming next and looking at the guys in this range i i probably put him in there probably ahead of lambos like i said i think lambos probably caps off this range but um if if we go like something like tomala shake up pinelli lambos anyone have any objections to that no i think that's a good spot for lambos to fall in all right so tamala sweet all right now this next range is is like i joked earlier that it opened up but it this this range really does open up like once we get into the guys like ryder korazak sebastian kosa dylan duke ayrton martino mason mctavish uh course and coolman's is in this range probably at least in the conversation um but it's a it's a big group of guys so anyone have any guy that they want to maybe uh put put a name for maybe this is the perfect time for braden to talk about zachary bolduc being a first or fifth runner yeah well i was actually gonna bring up zach dean but but i mean to go along with that yeah um there comes a point where we should definitely talk about zach balduc and um everything that he is and everything that he isn't i guess um but i know that's kind of the the joke or the running joke but um i was just talking with uh with nick well this morning a little bit about him and uh to be to be honest i have him closer to the the top of this range now at this point um there was a time probably around christmas where i was like this guy yeah is like a fourth rounder i'm really not impressed with his effort i'm really not impressed with his defensive play but but now i think there's just too much um too much raw ability too much foundational ability to ignore in terms of his skating in terms of his puck handling there's there's not a lot of guys who are able to rein in a really terrible puck at mock chicken um blowing up the the wing like he does um and he does it more consistently now than he used to i think i don't know what changed when the qmjhl went on hiatus for a little while and and now came back but he seems like he's a totally different player now so um really i mean we could we could have him here but we could we could wait a while i don't know it depends if there's anybody that is any that anybody else is really in love with and provides a more consistent um you know supply of whatever their skills might be this might be a good spot for them but tony i know you and i talk to like there is a certain concern that you have to have about a player being so inconsistent and you know even if he is or does seem to be an invaluable player right now in a lot of ways um if there's these ebbs and flows um game to game or month to month that sort of thing um what do you do with that i think with the queue that's an interesting thing because the the q season itself has been such a roller coaster you know guys getting ramped up and then being forced to shut down and go weeks between games and things like that um bulldup's interesting i got him a little bit lower than this range but i think like the i like his skating i find he's got a really clean stride it's powerful i like the way that he affects the game in transition both ways like i find lately he's really tracking back through the neutral zone a lot better getting inside positioning and you know kind of being able to lift sticks and grab pucks from behind he loves the stick whip like he he's a big big big time uh stick checker like you know he and maybe it's because he has the the reach to do it but i find like nobody stick checks more than he does yeah but he's been quite efficient at it from what i've seen lately anyways and i like his his shot too i think you know he can beat goaltenders at least at the q level from distance so you can beat them cleanly uh i think there's a lot to like there but he's like definitely kind of a project um in this range i know i just kind of made a dig at him when we were talking about the last group but i do have course in coulombs in this range i just think like if if you're willing to put them with your development staff like the tools that that kid has got as i see dylan shaking his head at me here but i i'd like the offensive ability the decision-making is definitely questionable but i think that's something that can be improved upon with his skating ability his willingness to play physically he moves the puck well he's he can beat the first layer on the floor check by himself before addition to a teammate in the neutral zone i just think there's a lot to like there but he's maybe one of the more risky guys in this range i'm happy to jam in uh zach dean and mason yeah i've got him any time i've got zach dean right around here too i i was gonna bring up mason mctavish because i'm definitely not gonna be the one pushing for him in this range because quite frankly i'm not a fan to be completely honest like his shot's ridiculous like that's a good tool but like i question almost everything else about his game um so i'd love for someone to try to convince me that he's he's better than i think because yeah i'm just not a a huge mesh mctavish fan despite the fact that i think he's going to make an nhl paycheck on a power play for sure uh i'll push because we've had the conversation before too and i've sent kind of my piece for that i still think mace mctavish has the upside to be a first-time player or at least in the top six in the nhl uh yeah you're right like his shot is unbelievable and even just um where they've got him playing right now um he's in slovakia with brandon hoffman which is kind of cool uh they're on the same team but um they they've got him up front of the net a lot not even just uh on the power play but just in general like his his job kind of on this team is to get in front and like cause havoc and he he actually does it really really well so when i when i look especially in this range um also when we were talking about um bulldog and dean it's a it's the exact same things it's the the upsides there the raw tools are there but just the consistency is is off all the time like it and not even like game to game consistency it's shift to shift consistency with mcdonald's like this times i sent tony a clip i can send it to everyone but there's one play where he just absolutely dominated in transition like made a perfect like perfect cycle gets the puck goes through half the team and then gets a great shot on goal and i was like holy crap like that's an unbelievable play like this is this is fantastic this is what he should be doing all the time and then the next shift he just stands on the wall and does nothing in transition for 30 seconds and they struggle to get in and he did nothing so the upside is there it's just the work ethic is just completely inconsistent but for this range where everyone is kind of a gamble i think he does have the raw tools and then he has the nhl frame he can play physical he brings something to the power play he has the offensive instincts and he can he can produce upfront i think it's worth it for this range of guys like mason mctavish like i said i think he's going to be an nhl player like i have no doubts about that pretty much um so based on that maybe i could i could see him in this range and stuff but like i have real concerns about his foot speed and maybe that is just the consistency thing like he just doesn't try sometimes um but like there's a lot of times even in the defensive zone where i'm just like he's just standing around doing that sitting on the wall for 30 seconds and you don't know what he's doing and part of that's i'm sure part of it's his uncomfortability just going over season in learning a new league learning a new team and and playing with players who maybe don't speak the language that he speaks as well so um he's a guy that i think definitely should be in this range i'd probably push him down a little bit further but again like i'm more than willing to let you guys make that decision because yeah like the i admittedly i'm not a maze mctavish fan so i don't want to be the guy on him either he hasn't played very much this year um he's got like a handful of games so the kovid has maybe hurt him more than a lot of other players uh his rookie season in the ohl was pretty impressive it started off strong and kind of cooled down as the season went on but the pete's were a pretty stacked team for him to have the impact he did as a 16 year old rookie um made a pretty strong impression for me and at the end of last season i was really high on him and i just wonder how much of of of you guys shared that sort of opinion about him at the time and has he just been surpassed because he's not playing i think that's definitely a factor for mctavish yeah like him not playing definitely factors in for in a lot of people's rankings but like even going back and like looking at my list from earlier in the year like i had him 29 20 like 30 31 like almost all year and even on my last list it was at 32 like i have him at the end of the first round so it's not like if we put him in at 27 it'd be crazy high for me or anything like that um but i do have concerns about his game whereas like a guy like ryder korzak like who's also in this range i think he just plays a bit more of a complete game he has that that skating issue similar to mctavish but he he works through it because of his work rate is just being so much higher um i think ryder korsak is a guy that deserves some mention in this range because he does he's a dual threat he does everything in the whl he's not great defensively but um no 510 511 player really is in the whl because it's such a physical league so i think ryder korzak's a guy that he he's able to score he puts up tons of numbers and and i think there's a lot of the the connor zerry effect that zerry got last year like a lot of people knocked his scoring totals because he was such an older player for the draft class and with ryder korzak and maybe that does bump him down but i don't know how much further bumps him down than where we're at right now um if everyone's kind of in the same conversation there maybe we go mctavish korzak if everyone is okay with that unless somebody or maybe even mctavish dean korzak or dean mctavish korzak i'm i'd like to throw matt coronado in here too i know he's a player that you and i have talked a lot about in recent weeks tony i just think that you know the way he's been able to sustain his offensive production this year and kind of keep improving as the season goes along i know he's one of the older players in the class but there's just some offensive tools there that are hard to ignore um i don't know if anyone else is comfortable with him in this range but i think if he can you know he's he's a fine skater when he has some room to get going i think he's able to like kind of carry the puck through the neutral zone if he's presented with space and can get ahead of steam um maybe needs to add some of that explosiveness like he me and tony talked about this a lot he kind of gets caught on his heels when he's standing still and it limits his ability to kind of like get off that first quick step and you know jump into a different area but he does have the awareness to kind of like see those spaces in the offensive zone and and make himself available for passes and his shot is just it he's got a really good shot compared to a lot of the other guys in this draft class i think he's going to be able to score at the nhl level and probably deserves to be in this conversation right now too yeah i don't have anything against matthew coronado being in this conversation either um if we're gonna put him in there though i think ayrton martino deserves some credit in here um i know there's a lot of people who are either super high on him or super low on him um he is an all-out offensive guy like his defensive game is okay i guess like he's active in skating defensively but he doesn't really know where to go in i don't he's played in three different levels in the last year he was originally in the ojhl uh went to the bchl for the preseason and then went to the ushl when the bcho shut down after that and um he's been great for omaha in my opinion one of the most dangerous offensive players and one of the most skilled offensive players in the ushl period so um aj maybe i know you're a fan of him so maybe you gotta give a little bit of take on him i like him he's offensive he's got a lot of upside uh i saw him score on a peak on a penalty kill which was pretty fun uh he's just got a lot of skill yeah i really like them and i was going to bring them up so yeah yeah i think this range is really really wide open so what if we go something like um mctavish because everyone outside of me i think everyone seems to be a big fan of mctavish so we don't can i make one more note on ball duke before we maybe go for tony like if we're considering what players are left i don't know i would i guess i'd ask everybody else to comment on this but balduc is a guy who i think if if things go well for him he could be in and he could be an effective player on the first line in the nhl um i don't know if there are any other players remaining that fit that bill that being said he could also totally miss um and there's that that risk but i think the other guy you mentioned zach dean is probably maybe has that bit of upside i don't know exactly i don't know if i would yeah if i don't if i would classify zack dean as a player with like a first line upside i definitely think he has less risk of missing because i think you know shift to shift he is more consistent he he applies himself in a four checking role really well which is something i haven't seen quite as much from bald duke but dean i think i would feel a little safer about um but i wouldn't ever necessarily expect him to uh develop into a really effective first line player like volduk maybe could no i might have jumped the gun there a little bit but i think um just like the uh as a complimentary player perhaps maybe not in a top-line role but i think he definitely has the potential to do that in the top six for an hl team he's always hounding pucks i think if he can maybe learn to slow the game down a little bit and let things come to him more often rather than just playing at 100 miles an hour at all times i think there's definitely something there for kind of a two-way forward who can chip in offensively yeah i i guess it's just it's the question of philosophy is are we are we do we want a player who seems like he could contribute in multiple ways and potentially play on your second line um or do you want a player who's risky and could potentially play on your your first line all right so what i have right now is uh 28 mctavish 29 korzak 30 ayrton martino and then i'll let you guys make that you know i'm going to put martino at 31 in between bullduck and dean and braden you're the qmhl guy i'll let you decide who's at 30 and who's at 32. yeah you got to do it well that then it's yeah for me it's zach dean i guess um ahead of all duke and and um i'll maintain that philosophy i think for for a while so i'm even okay with with dropping ball duke a little bit more if there's someone else who fits a similar build to zach dean like um i guess i'd probably like to have coronado ahead of bowl duke still at this point yeah yeah like like i said like he's still got that that range where i don't know if you really don't like him and you really you really see um those flaws and the inconsistencies as a big factor he could go you know as late as uh the mid to end of the second round but um there is that there's that that carrot of him potentially be a really impactful player all right so how about we do it like this then um so 27 is pinelli that's where we left off 28 carson lambos uh 29 mctavish 30 korzak 31 dean 32 martino 33 coronado and 34 uh zachary bolduc i'm good with that all right now we've been here for a very long time already so let's take a quick bathroom break because i'm fidgeting over here so uh let's take a bathroom break and grab a drink grab a coffee grab a snack or something and meet back in like five minutes how about that all right well the team's grabbing a quick drink and getting a break i figured i'd jump in here real quick just to give a shout to instead hockey they've been helping us all year long and we've been lucky enough to partner with them to help scout and evaluate players from all over the world in a year that's not really the easiest thing to do so instead is as everyone kind of knows by now is one of the best platforms out there they've got a wealth of player data team data and incredibly database of video they're the elite of the elite when it comes to aiding and player development scouting and analysis for any team or organization looking for help looking for a way to get an edge instead hockey is the way to do that and if if you can think you your organization can use it definitely reach out to insect because they're always looking to add people to their team too let's uh let's get back into this now that everyone's taking their little break and dylan's dylan's walking around but he's not important anyways so i mean you left them all i think you left them off uh the like i think you forgot to mention him in the last uh podcast for uh the rankings too i did i definitely did i noticed it afterwards he messaged me he goes you didn't even mention me i'm like ah probably on purpose that's what i figured uh all right so now in order to keep this from going for five hours and making sure that we all have some part of our sunday to deal with outside of seeing my face uh let's just start if someone wants to vote for somebody in this next range um we're outside the first round now there's a lot of diverse like divisiveness with a lot of these players um um sasha pass another guy like that um dylan duke as long as we get him ahead of passage off i'm i'm fine with um but at the same time like claire who's not here unfortunately she she's not completely the opposite way she's a fan of past job over duke um so let's start there with the two american guys before we get to the goalie um does anyone have any opinions on passenger versus duke because these guys are are the two best offensive players pretty much they play on the same line a lot of times for the nttp um anyone have any opinion on one versus the other i've got duke far far ahead of pastor job i just i don't think pastor john plays with enough pace he doesn't seem aware defensively at all he appears disinterested when he doesn't have the puck um we talked about this a bit tony i think he probably makes a living as a power play guy yeah the next level but at even strength i don't i think he's probably gonna do more harm than good uh i definitely like duke a lot more than pass the job duke competes hard he he gets in tight he's got good hands around the net he he does a lot around the net i think he's probably gonna make a living there in the nhl with some power play utility and yeah i just think he he uh translates to the next level a lot better than pass the job does yeah my thing with those two guys right now is like neither of them are good skaters like let's just get that out of the way like right off the bat like both of them are probably slightly below average skaters um but the thing with dylan duke is he works around it like he's able to get his feet moving and get going so um i think they probably should be somewhat close because past job does have that offensive game that like i said like one shot or one pass from him can really change the game and put put a puck in the back of the net but i probably favor duke um we could probably push past the job down a little bit um especially with guys like kuliman salman and uh vince nyorio and evan now it's kind of coming up as well mackie samus i know there's a lot of big fans of him where's everyone at on tai voight i think he's probably in this range too i love typhoid like he was my guy coming into the year um i thought i was super high on him when i had him in like the 50s at the start of the year and then i seen like elite prospects rank him in the first round i went okay i guess i don't know his size is a huge issue for me though and like i'm we joked about me being like wanting to rank only guys under 510 but like his size is a real issue despite the offensive tools yeah i love oh sorry go ahead caitlyn all right i'm just gonna say i'd yeah i'd agree with that i i'm also really high on twitter i haven't quite had my list um he's he's one of the guys is always moving really good movement uh obviously he can score he's always involved but i i see him get pushed off the puck like so often and it's kind of okay at the ohl level but his size and his strength are just massive issues here yeah i i like typhoid i think we're going to rank them i almost guarantee we're going to rank them but like probably a lot lower than where elite prospects had about like i think they had them at 20 24 or 25 like to me that's just such a big risk especially like even the guys we're talking about in this range like dylan duke and and even sasha passengers who's not a big guy or a great skater by any means but he does have that one-shot ability to change a game kind of thing so um i'd kind of be pushing dillon duke here um vince niorio would be my next guy probably if if it's not samu salman um he's the guy i've really liked uh e2 and i have talked about times i think i'm a little bit higher than a2 is but uh what's your take on salman anitu um i think his problem is his skating other than that he's a really good player he hasn't played in like like three months i think because of the covet situations are different in different areas in finland um but he's a really smart player and he has really good offensive tool set but the skating is probably the thing which is dropping him the most um what what comes to his effort it's really good and he tries to defend a lot but he really doesn't know how to use our position stuff but most important thing is that he is he has a good effort also in the defensive zone and he wants to learn all the time doesn't really matter if he isn't that good in that area at the moment now one of the things i always like to do when i'm looking at a list like this is i look at a guy like brent johnson and i'm a big fan of brent johnson i like his game a lot but like and then i look at the guys that we're kind of talking about and i go would i take brent johnson ahead of these guys and i look at guys like sebastian kosa probably not dylan duke probably not passive job yeah probably brett harrison maybe uh coursing coolman's i'd probably take brent johnson above him because i think there's a bit more refinement despite coleman's maybe having a bit more offensive pop um so i think brent johnson deserves to be in this conversation but um who we putting at 35 are we gonna go with dylan duke there i think it's gotta be between duke or sebastian cosa for me yeah i like duke all right cool so duke's at 35. um before we get moving on too far i do want to talk about sebastian kosa a huge goaltender i think he's six six or yeah six six two twelve yeah so you you do worry about that length being too much at times because sometimes it's a little harder for those goalies to move around the ice but coast is really good at moving around his crazy he's efficient in his movements and um i've said it a few times where i think he's the best goaltender outside of the big three in the last three years and in the big threes obviously knight oscar oven in walstadt but i think coast is the best one outside of those three in the last three years so i'd push for him here personally um he's gonna i mean he's looked great in in whl in his first game basically so um hopefully we continue seeing that and edmonton's just so head and shoulders above every other team that that alberta division it's going to be tough to really get a gauge on him but there's still skill players out there that are going to test them so i think cosa goes in at 36 here um unless anyone else has any objection to that all right now someone would putting salmon and next be all that crazy too like no think i people are really high on him so i guess not but i yeah i just don't like him that much but i think he's a good player and i don't think that's too high all right so let's put him at 36. he definitely needs to be higher than harrison in my opinion at least i mean at least what i saw from harrison in finland he wasn't really impressive to be honest yeah harrison's a guy that i'm going to be curious as to where we settle on him at um so let's talk have the course in coolman's conversation because that's going to happen and i know dylan doesn't want to have it um i'd have him closer to 50 personally he's he's skilled he can make good passes offensively but like i don't know what he's doing 95 of the time when he's on the ice and i i think there's a base to work with there and that's that's something i always try to look at is is if an nhl team gets their hands on this kid and can build off that base what can they do and with coolman's there's a player there but i just don't know what it is i know nick you're a little bit higher on him and a few others might be as well so maybe we talk about him a little bit i think it's to your point the base right like the the toolkit to work with there while he might be a bit more of a long-term project who needs a lot of refinement in his game really needs to work on his decision-making i just think like the raw skill and skating ability and just willingness to to engage physically and try to impact the game i i think that it's something that's valuable in this range he's just another one of those guys that you really got to trust your development staff i i there's really not much more to say about him other than that so if we're going to have the the coleman's conversation i feel like we should bring up evan now and vince and i oreo so uh brayden talk about evan daus a little bit because i know you and i are both big fans of him yeah i like evan now it's quite a lot he uh he uh he's he's consistent he doesn't do a whole lot wrong um every once in a while you'll see him make a uh wonky pass uh out of the defensive zone like he almost blacks out for half a second but i mean that that is that is really looking hard for um things to find as flaws in his game i think for the most part he's very consistent through transition he uh he holds the blue line well he pinches well um he can quarterback a power play really well um across the board i think he's he's got a little bit upside i know we don't see a whole lot of production out of him um or maybe as much as um as much as you see out other offensive defensemen in junior but but every time i watch him and this is something that you and i have talked about before do you you think that he should be um you know accruing more points than he is um because he he does get involved in the offense he can be he can be really creative and elusive with the puck he protects the puck well in transition so um across the board i think he's uh i think he's got a lot going for him and very minor things to correct um that are very few and far between so as far as as far as a player with um who's who i think is a really safe bet um evan evan mouse definitely fits the bill for sure i think he's a good case study like talking about coolman's just prior to to him just because the refinement in naos game and like how he keeps things simple just kind of plays a little more steady whereas coolermen's is you're really just kind of projecting the skill set and hoping that you can reign in the decision making and things like that i think now's a pretty safe bet in this range yeah if that if that's if that's the question of coleman's like um like i i to be completely honest i haven't watched coleman's at all but uh with with mouse i really don't have a whole lot of question marks um let me say the biggest the biggest flaw that i find sometimes is that it seems like once or twice a game it'll just kind of um throw a pass into traffic and uh i think that's something that can be corrected i think you can you know make a guy aware that you're concerned about his decision-making in the defensive zone um periodically but um if he if he puts a little bit of focus on you know eliminating that aspect of his game i think uh i think he's a really good option to be um a second pair uh defenseman at some point in his career and i think vincent ayorio falls into that same uh category as evan now so whereas he's so ref like i don't want to say refined but he's still composed with the puck he's so he just understands what what he needs to do next um he's always thinking one step ahead and he always kind of has a plan for what he's gonna do with the puck even in those like quick uh quick decision moments where he's uh going back to uh retrieve a dump in or something like that with a forechecker right on him he just understands where to put the puck next um and to me that's what separates those two guys from a guy like carson of course in coleman's um because they they do have that that level of puck skill that he also has but they don't feel the need to pull it out all the time and and with course and coolman's i almost feel like he tries too hard as much as that sounds with the  on the stick um he always wants to make that huge play he always wants to make that play that that looks great and um it doesn't always work out and the tools are there and the base is there um dylan i know you have concerns about course colemans as well as i do so uh maybe kind of state your case uh on that regard well i mean first of all he's playing in the ajhl which immediately makes me not want to not rank him at all um i don't know i'm just whenever i watch him i'm just not blown away by anything in particular um defensively it's always worrying everyone that i've talked to about him is like yeah he'd be really good if your team is playing positionless hockey and you can just kind of let him do whatever he wants um there's just not a lot of control to his game uh i'm just never like seeing a first round guy when i'm watching him it's always you know maybe this guy makes the nhl maybe he just you know flounders out you know can't get his defensive game to a level that's going to be able to compete with nhler's um but i mean if he can reach that upside he's obviously pretty solid offensively um it's just i'm just never really uh convinced by him to be that guy all right so i my big thing is i look at him and i look at a guy like brent johnson and i go which one am i willing to take the bet on um and so well let's start with this i think iorio and even evan aus are probably the next two names on this list at this point um i think we've all kind of talked about how they both project well they will have uh a lot of composure to their game and and you you can see them being an nhl defender so i think 38 and 39 those two guys should fit in there um once we get into the 40s that's where i'm more willing to entertain course and coolman's um i think yeah i was gonna say i think mackie samus comes into the conversation here as well um this is where for liam though nielsen as well yeah i was just gonna say the interior to tell us why william strong shouldn't be here we'll get to that later don't you i'm not gonna make it i'm not gonna make him yell at me yet um so so let's go let's go with uh yeah the swedes are always nice people he's never gonna yell at me he just sends me mean dms whatever i'm just going to ignore that but uh so evan nelson vincennario are 38 39. um sasuko job i think probably fits into this range as well i know like i said claire is really high on them i've seen the flashes that make people high on him so uh putting him at 40 is not that bad of an idea um now we get into um like i said liam darren nielsen um jeremy wilmers may be in this conversation a bit later too but brent johnson versus corson coolman's that's the one i'm kind of curious about the group's think on that um aj i know you've seen brent johnson quite a bit so what's your take on his game and i know you've seen coolman's a bit so what do you kind of think between those two i have tony i didn't know that i could have swore you were one of those guys that were high oh never mind then no just me being an idiot look at that i haven't i've barely watched 50 games man you hired me like last week i swear i thought you were you had said you'd seen him so all right games in one week is pretty good aj so uh yeah i'm pretty proud but i have no day job so that's part of it to get it back on the rails a little bit i know i i'm probably the highest on coulombs at anyone here so i am totally fine if you guys want to still push them down the list a little ways don't feel like you have to squeeze them in here well like i think the range i had in there was 30 to 50 and that's the range that was also put in there afterwards as well so i don't think that's a we're in a bad spot 41 is kind of right in the middle of that um i think putting him in there um is fine if anyone wants to put brent johnson ahead with me i'm fine with doing that as well but otherwise i think cool man's at 41 is fine i uh i got some some games in on brent johnson after uh will was hyping him up in the discord and so i saw a couple games and like i think like there's not much between him and coolman's but i think that i'm pretty confidently putting him ahead of kuhlman's uh just you know he's just been great this year in the ushl probably the best of one of the best defensemen in the league like the entire league all right so let's do 41 brent johnson because i got my way and a dictator and this is how things work and then 42. thank you i just need one voice to be like yeah right so now let's get into liam dowd nelson because he's a guy i really like in this range as well um it's a little bit of a high pick for him in terms of like the public sector and in what i've seen in terms of his ranking but i think he's more than willing to be in this right in his range so uh mikhail talk about him a bit well i see quite quite the potential upside for him as well that he could because he's such a smart player like he's always it feels like he's always in the correct position he's reading plays defensively he's he's using his hands aren't like the most gifted but he like uses them to create some space for himself and get out of tough spots he he's amazing on the power play like he he can dictate the power play from behind the net and he's just like you can control it from users to behind that's like a point like a point like playing the points so i i i really enjoy him and i think like he could have some like if he reaches his top top top potential he could be a second line center for sure i see him like uh like a victor asked before he uh before he turned bad or something like that like someone saw him like current battery it's a better turned into a pumpkin uh yeah exactly but i think he something something like a victor type of player i see in liam donaison i guess he could be a 50 point senator for sure in the in the show i feel like yeah i agree with you i i think he's got enough skill to make his game work and i i think he's he's good enough in every area i think right he's one of those guys that you don't look at and you're like here's the one major flaw that is going to be detrimental to him making it to the next level like even his flaws aren't to the point where you look at him and go like he's not going to make it or something right so um unless anyone has any objection i'm more than willing to put him at 43. um i think that's where brent johnson or brent harris brett harrison conversation maybe starts um caitlyn i know you've seen him a bit so uh what's your take on on brett harrison's game yeah um he he's not the most sort of he's not the guy who's gonna wow you but he's very hard-working he's kind of that two-way center type um he's not really the one to drive the play but he he he can sort of apply himself and and compete in all zones um i'm i think i'm lower on brett harrison than a lot of other people just because i just haven't seen a ton from him and and especially especially recently but yeah he's he's one of those steady guys he's responsible he can he can make the right pass make the right play when he needs to um but yeah i'm not super high on him but i take him kind of in this range yeah i know i've talked to jacob a few times about brett harrison and we always come to the conclusion like if he's just on your line facilitating as either a left wing or as a center and he's able to kind of get into his spots to use his shot i i think that's more than a good spot for him i think i think he's a great he's got a good shot he's not gonna be the guy that's burning up and down the ice he plays a methodical game and um i i i like him but yeah it's not like i'm he's a guy that i'm banging the table for um i don't think really at any point unless you he starts falling really bad but um i know jacob's a fan of him too and he has him kind of in this range so um unless there's any objections to his game here i know e2 you've seen him a little bit too so uh what's your take there um i think this is a good range as i said i i wasn't too impressed but um i i liked that he he was a really good play maker when he played in finland but he's his skating was wasn't too good i think it was even worse than solomon s yeah his skating is definitely an issue and i think that's kind of what holds him back from taking that step to being like a legitimately dangerous player on every shift um but he he's smart he's he makes good pat like he makes the play to the right spot and everything so um damn it brayden um uh but yeah brett harrison's a guy that i think in this range isn't uh isn't a reach by any means because i think he could be a a good solid third line center that plays at both ends of the ice yeah and um i actually the games i saw i heard were not that good games from him i i heard that he played better games when he like got the new finnish finnish style and the bigger ring and stuff and then he was i heard that he was really good in some games also i think this is a good range we shouldn't drop him more all right so i'm happy putting him here this entire carrot juice coffee situation is crazy um my adhd is kicking in i don't think there's another like q player for like 30 picks roughly so i know i've got a couple i'll bring up for you brayden you can tell me why i have them but uh one player i think we need to have a conversation about is matthew samuskevich um this guy i've seen as high as like 13 or 14 on some rankings and i think those people are lunatics who are just flying by the seat of the pants and and have my mindset of draft the skill and upside in literally don't care about anything else with him um but he's got the skill he's got the shot um i've talked to ryan hardy a couple times and he's always the guy that he that he's pushing from the steel um so i i there's a lot of gms a lot of coaches that seem to see a lot in this kid um the skill is there he just he's small he doesn't do a whole lot off the puck and and you worry about that but when he's got the puck on his stick he's one of the most giftable players in the draft he's one of the most like you see the highlights and you're like man like this why isn't this guy a first-round pick and then you watch the game and you go okay well there's the defensive issues and stuff so um at 45 i think that's a fine range for him uh like i said i know claire is a lot higher on him as well and uh she thinks he's a guy that could kind of be that third guy in a wing on the wing and be the guy that just contributes offensively for a line and i don't disagree with that factor at all like if that's the situation and get himself in i think he'd be perfectly productive so unless anyone's opposed to it i think him at 45 wouldn't be a bad idea um jack o'brien is a guy that looked way better in the whl last year than than what he does now now he's not looking the best but um it's gonna yeah it's gonna be interesting to see what exactly he turns into at the next level with jack o'brien because um when he was playing with with seth jarvis last year he looked great like there's no doubt about that but he was playing with seth jarvis and that's a big factor like seth jarvis is making the ahl look like a joke so um i'm not sure where i'd put jack o'brien but matthew samus i think is a guy that kind of fits in at 45 unless anyone has any uh objection to that all right who is next on the list for somebody someone thrown a name for a guy that they'd like to get uh some love to uh arjun kruznikov ah why he hasn't played it all this year but you know i don't want to drop too far because of that um ohl sucks true stupid canada you guys can get anything right so i just before we go any further i just want to make sure that everyone is aware for anybody that ends up listening to this that our mhl guy has insulted the ajhl which is fair i totally agree with that one but and now the ohl as well and i'm sure he's going to do the whl as well at some point so go ahead w sucks there we go all right dylan what's uh what's your your take on uh he's just rock solid defensively um doesn't really like stand out with like high-end plays just a lot of reliability with him uh obviously hasn't been able to play it all this year would have liked to see him come back to russia um definitely could have been playing maybe even khl minutes at this point um but he just like there's some things that he needs to work on he's passing out of the defensive zone um leaves to leave stuff to be desired um but he's physical he's uh really solid defensively he'll throw the body he'll get uh picky with a stick he'll jump in on plays uh as for his upside i don't think that he's like gonna blow out anything out of the water so i mean if there's more like boomer bus picks maybe you take them ahead of him but if you're looking for somebody who's gonna really be solid on your bottom pairing maybe even push for that second pairing uh he's your guy now mikhail there's a guy that kind of fits a similar profile in sweden in anton olsen so so give me your take on his game um uh anthony is a mainly defensive defenseman who i watch lately and doesn't do anything for me anymore when i see him in the shl he doesn't produce any offense he throws the puck to ice saying he like i watched two the latest two games i think he was and he he was in like his when he was on the ice he was in the off like his team was in the offensive zone twice maybe in two games so he's i don't see any ups like he any upside with him and i don't think his defense have been has been as good as we thought it was earlier as well so i think he can slip for 25 picks more or something yeah i agree well he's a guy who like the more i watch him he keeps just kind of bumping further down my list every time i watch him play it's just there's not a lot there i don't think he's probably he's a smart player i think he understands how to defend he's maybe still just a little over matched at the shl level uh but there's not much offense there and he's not going to be driving play from the back end or anything like that yeah when i look at my notes on him like from you know october november and then from more recently it's like nothing has changed i have the same exact comments about his game he hasn't really grown at all i don't think and i think that's caused him to fall a bit more for me too i agree with mikael on the range for that i think he's a good third round target but i think defensively one thing i have a problem with is that he shies away from using his body at all you're always seeing him like flailing his stick out a lot more and he gets beat because of that sometimes and i think that i don't know if that's somewhat just a positioning issue or something that he can work on with a coach or if there's some laziness involved in that but i think that uh he really hasn't done it for me either yeah and if you're talking about olson as well i'd like you and eastern even better than than wilson right now but you'll need to make an over age as well as you have to take that into account so all right so dylan i'm cool with putting grishnikov next and kind of getting in there but the one question i have is is where do we put aiden horace because sometimes he's really good and other times he's really bad and and he was a guy that i thought coming into the year was going to be a lot better than he is so um anyone have any idea like any comment on his game maybe dylan like would you take him over gryshnikov or would you still lean grishnikov there the issue is uh harashaka is like he's progressed backwards this year i feel like uh towards the start of the year he was like i was pushing top 15 even not that long ago i was trying to like i had him in a group for my top 15 and i watched more of him and i was like okay he was pretty solid start of the year and now he's just kind of there he's not uh doing a lot anymore uh defensively he's still you know one of the better defensive players on that team but uh i just he's he's so weird because of how much he's fallen off in uh such a short span of time that it's hard to rank him especially since he's not like one of the younger players like if he was like jeremy wilmer's age i'd be like okay he'll probably end up bouncing back but he's you know a february birthday uh i'm just he's very confusing i i'm not really sure where i would put him right now at all am i crazy to have sean barrons ahead of press jack at this point i think i think crash chuck's more likely to be an nhl player i don't really see barons being i i don't want to say i don't see him being an nhl player but i don't see i see him having a lot more hurdles to jump over to get there i think hashtags can have a lot easier time becoming uh that kind of like number six guy maybe we're just gonna hold the fort defensively and then maybe chip in offensively barons is just i think the size with barons is probably gonna be something that holds him back but but i i really like the way he plays the game i think he's like decisive when he's got the puck on his stick he likes to attack and i think he's pretty smart defensively as well but but the size is probably what's gonna hold him back yeah i think with barons like the thing with him is like he when he has the puck on the stick especially in the offensive zone he can do some things like some some real high-end stuff and you look at him and you go okay like there's there's a first-round pick here um my concern comes when when he's playing defensively on the rush or even especially when he's like trying to defend sustained zone pressure he just he seems so lost and it's not just a strength thing with him or a size thing with him and just in the defensive zone he just doesn't seem to know exactly what to do and when he get like i said when he gets that loose puck and he's able to get it on his stick it's a different game with him so um the upside's there for sure like if someone were to try to push for barons in this range i know claire has him uh rigged in this range uh so it's not crazy to think he'd be here um but him and harass truck are both kind of guys i put closer together than a lot of people at the start of the year and and i mean i guess people had them close at the start of the year they were just both first rounders at the start of the year and now they're not so um it's gonna be an interesting one i had a ryan of code to this conversation as well because i noticed there's some uh divisiveness between his ranges here uh he's another small defensive in the ushl and i mean i think he's uh ahead of barons personally but claire really likes efco too yeah claire likes him a lot she was hyping him up so i went and watched him more uh he's better defensively than barons he's uh they're kind of at the same level offensively they kind of do different things in the zone uh upco's just kind of a really smart player he moves the puck more efficiently he's great on the power play but i mean it's a chicago steel power play so i mean it's pretty easy to look good on that yeah i want to throw another chicago steel defender in here i know another guy i'm probably higher on than most but i really like jack bear like the the tools that he's got i think he he's like he's really elusive for a guy his size he's able to kind of skate the puck out of trouble in the defensive zone i think he protects it well on retrievals and just kind of moving it to the available outlet he kind of senses pressure well but he also kind of maybe takes too many risks he really likes to jump up into the rush and he does have the ability to recover but i think he's got to kind of manage that risk reward a little bit better uh he's a guy that probably needs to work on his his mobility when it comes to like pivoting defending the rush and stuff like that but i think he keeps a tight gap he's good at sort of directing guys where he wants to go but if they get that kind of outside step on him he has trouble from that point but he he's another guy he's like unlike barons and ufco he's got the size to kind of compete at the next level he's another guy i have in this range just personally all right so before we start assigning rankings to some of these defensemen i want to get uh itsu in here to talk about billy coivanon this guy has been a fun fun player sami helenius is another guy in this range uh pick one of those to e2 and who you think goes higher and give give your take on why he should be here um i don't think i neither of those guys are in this range actually um e2 hates spins yeah he's just taking over yoki's role my region but um helenius is really good as it's crazy that he's a 18 year old guy playing liga and his physicality against men is really good and he's a elite penalty killer and the guy is yeah he's a good player but he doesn't really have that ceiling that upside he doesn't have that much offensive skill so i don't think he will go that high maybe early third is good for him and or late second and uh for covenant i don't think that he he would be this high so maybe maybe neither in this range but maybe after maybe somewhere around 55 we can take them into the discussion all right i'd like to throw in uh victor khan bore yourself in this area around this range yeah state your casey or miguel well he's he he's very smart like he found find space almost everywhere like openers that opens it up like gates into space try to relieve his defensemen when they need like need to find a past and he's got some nice play-making skills as well but he's a hard worker he's a great force checker and he's very solid defensively he also plays like regularly on in which is in in the shell which is the i think third number one in the league if they're not then they're number two so i think he he needs to be considered on this range because he i think i like him a lot and i think he's going to get better with the more opportunity he gets as well yeah i don't i don't disagree with you there at all he's a guy that i've really liked when i've seen him so uh how are we feeling about this uh after krishnakava is 46 47 ryanofco 48 jack o'brien get him in there because like i said there's a lot there to like but he didn't kind of run the coattails of seth jarvis a little bit last year but he's still doing some good things in the ushl then victor sternberg uh jack o'brien or jack barr sorry at 50. uh aiden rush truck at 51. um anyone opposed to any of those those guys at those spots all right now this is where i make my case for jeremy wilmer the small tiny little guy from the us national team and i i feel like every time i make my case i have to classify that he's a small small guy but this guy just makes the right play so often he's just always doing um the small thing right whether it's it's he's getting along the board he's chipping the pass to the middle or he's fighting around the net he does a lot of things well and his size really doesn't play as much a factor as a lot of guys his size like i see him framing up in the in the corners and stuff and using his body position to really excel so um jeremy wilmer is a guy that i had at 51 on my rankings 52 here i wouldn't be opposed to um but there's guys like shawn barons who i'm willing to talk about as well here um and then we can kind of get into some of the other guys too so um i think maybe we go bearings at 52 in wilmer at 53. if everyone's okay with that i'd flip-flop them personally but that was my first in inclination as well as flip-flopping them and then putting barons at 53 and wilmer at 52. um anyone opposed to that that's almost exactly what i have on my list here so okay perfect all right and now now maybe do we get to that anton olsen range i i still think he probably goes down further um no put him in the third round yeah all right so now we get to um some more guys that are a little bit more uh divisive at least and this is where we can kind of get into the typhoid conversation i think he probably goes a little further though i think yeah i think this this could be a good range for helena news yeah yeah because while he doesn't have that much upside and he's not going to be probably not going to be a point scorer in the nhl i think his certainty is very good i think he yeah yeah because the physicality the frame and he's still a pretty good really good skater even though he's a big guy so i think he he's gonna be bottom six in a show player but i'm not top six yeah the floor alone i think makes him worthy of this range yeah exactly yeah he's such a good defensive player i think he really does warrant being in this conversation because he's smart he in when whenever he gets that offensive chance around the net he he dub d's and hands around the net and he can kind of convert once in a while there so i'm not opposed to him being there um dylan you have the next russian guy highlighted so uh give your case on him because he was a guy that i hadn't watched a whole lot until i seen that you you where you had him uh ranged at and i was like okay i gotta watch a couple games of this guy i really liked what i saw yeah dimitri karlevsky he's been playing in the vhl basically all year he has some sporadic mhl khl games um playing a lot with alexander kovanov on his wing um just another really good defensive forward coming out of russia which is not normal they usually just don't play defense at all but he's uh constantly moving around the ice he moves so well um very fluid uh uh apply pressure close down space gets the puck and then uh there's some issues when he has the puck uh especially outside the offensive zone just with his decision-making uh he struggles to make that first pass sometimes or if he should pass or she he should skate up the ice um that's just you know a small thing that's going to come with time uh he's obviously an 18 year old playing in a men's league it's not always easy for them to make the simple plays they're a place that looks simple um offensively i was kind of worried at the beginning of the year i watched him in the nhl and i thought okay he's kind of just playing as a defenseman once the puck is kind of in an area where they're about to lose it he'll immediately be sitting back further than his two defensemen but as the season has progressed he's developed well offensively he set the scoring record uh u18 the vhl most points in the season um he's just someone who's been rising for me he's not really a name that you see often but i mean what he's been doing in the vhl this year has been very good yeah he was a guy that like like i said i hadn't watched a ton of them up until i'd seen where you got him ranked and stuff and then when i i watched three games uh since you you you put him in that range and i was like okay like i want to get at least a decent read on this guy and yeah like i i'd have no opposition to putting him in this like 50 to 50 50 to 60 range because like like you said he's not a guy that gets a ton of love the vhl itself doesn't get a ton of love either so um i'd be comfortable putting him at 55 or 56 because like he does enough well that you can project him to the nhl level in him being at least a capable player so um unless anyone has any objections i know probably no one else has seen him so um there's probably not a whole lot there but um i'd be more than willing to put him here at 56 and then maybe we get to a guy like uh ty voigt um maybe this is where we can kind of start to talk about a guy like uh or philly covenant or uh nolan allen's another guy out west that'd be a good spot here um unless we want to get into the goalies or or matthew knees who's to me a guy but a lot of people like what they see with his skill has anybody kept up on jj moser i have he's okay like he he can score and stuff like my opinion on him is is sign him to an ahl deal don't draft him just sign him to an hl deal because he's almost at the age where you can and stuff so um i'm more than willing to bring him over i just don't know if i waste a draft pick on him right um and i mean waste is a harsh word but uh if i use a traffic on him because i you look at a guy like even like alexa him will sell me who we'll get into in a few minutes in a minute or two um but i take him for sure even though like most draft boards don't even know who that guy is so uh i think it's uh just drafting double overages this high yes kind of like super out of the question for me yeah um especially when it's somebody that you can sign so quickly and bring them over so quickly if it's maybe if he's like playing in the khl or something then there's some more value to it because you can kind of let him stay there a few more years you just have his rights forever but i mean playing in the swiss league you can just sign him i'm not using a pick on him yeah um the thing i i think was if you are a bad team that nobody wants to play for and there is a player who has yeah little teams after like free agency uh maybe then you want to trust him because you know that if there's other three teams trying to get him as a free agent you don't get it maybe then but yeah i see you your point yeah taking them in the seventh round is a swing that you're kind of willing to take but uh this high even in the top 100 i probably hesitate from it um but let's get into this next group here because there's there's a few guys that um they're kind of all over on rankings and stuff so um let's bring up wyatt johnson real quick and uh caitlyn maybe talk about him i i i saw him all the time last year he's plays in windsor so i'll talk about maybe after you okay um so i like quiet johnson to a point he's so smart passing good use of his body he seems like a pretty strong kid although he's only lifted uh listens 167 pounds right now um he's good at finding that open space he has a good shot uh kind of gets to the net a lot i think he's considered more of a two-way and i see that i didn't see a lot of there was nothing i saw from him that really made me super excited he's a very smart player he kind of knows where to be uh he's another one of those sort of capable two-way guys um decent top speed not amazing speed um but yeah i i can see him i i think i had him down as 50 to 70 so i can see him dropping a tiny bit more and i know there are some people who aren't quite as high on him but i i i wouldn't mind if he was in this range yeah my thing with him is like i i i i completely agree with everything you said there caitlyn and and the one thing that kind of makes me go okay maybe like there is something more here is the fact that last year when he was playing with uh john luke footy and uh will cooley that was the best those two looked all year long um like those two struggled at times last year and and i foodie was a guy that i saw a lot from and and thought he should have went higher but um wyatt johnson really kind of tied that line those two together and they i mean the season ended up getting cut short and uh they only played about five to seven games together but when they did like those two looked back like the first round picks everyone thought they were at the start of the year so um i'm curious to see where he ends up going uh he's one of those guys that i'm just excited to see when he gets back on the ice so um i i put him in this range i have nothing against that um carol kersenov is maybe a guy i put ahead of him so uh dylan maybe talk about uh your favorite defenseman uh yeah favorite um he's just so weird um he's almost like a blank canvas with who has just some of the pieces there and you can kind of mold him um he's a really good skater through the neutral zone uh he pivots well um uses crossovers really well to build up speed and he gets into the offensive zone and then he just has the puck and he doesn't know what to do with it and he just loses it and it's like well you probably could have done something better there maybe you know calm down a little bit uh defensively uh he's you know a work in progress but he's playing in the khl uh plays played in the vhl played the world juniors played everywhere um looked really solid with team russia at the buyer hockey games playing against men there it's just what is he gonna do in the two zones that matter the most rather than just in the neutral zone as a puck moving defenseman so like i i agree with what you're saying there and like he was the guy that i feel like people got a lot of hype for at the world juniors and they seem to like him there um yeah he's a guy that i put in this range um at 57 i probably have him like and i think that's a fair spot unless you disagree there dylan uh no i think that's fine um so 57 for him 58 at wyatt johnson and i slipped matthew knees in there at at 59 because i i know claire's super high in him he's got a ton of skill he reminds me a lot of matthew samuskevich but like the b-plus version of matthew samuskevich so um him being 20 10 spots 15 spots lower than semester which kind of fits for me um now we get to arrange that there's a lot of guys that we just kind of like i say this every 10 picks i feel like but we get to a range where they're it's it's super wide open again like we have guys like william stromgrind kind of in here um i know we're going to push him back a little bit um oliver kaepernick ty voigt uh billy coyvan are guys that i think we should probably talk about here um anton olsen maybe fits here um uh mikhail you think anton gets in here or alexa not quite yet but i guess since it is pretty wide open if people if there's anyone else who's watched him if michael wants to weigh in two on this i mean i think this is the earliest you could see him get picked it's not where i would pick him don't wait until the third round at least with them i think yeah it's awesome all right so let's talk about ty voigt the tiny little fella plays for starting to sting um he's a bit of a buzzsaw um he's got a decent shot he gets the the dirty areas but he gets pushed around all the time so um there's a lot of people that love this kid and the i think the processing of his game is is no issue like that's not that's not the problem um the skills aren't the issue that's not a problem he's a good he's a good not great skater um the the biggest red flag with him is the fact that he's little and i am always the guy that's like pumping guys for like hey it's okay if you're little like you can get by it but for whatever reason i can't get by it with high voigt so putting him at 60 kind of feels like a decent spot um i'd be willing to push him back more though if if others had that feeling so uh caitlyn based on some of the other ohl guys that are available right now you think he goes or is there someone else you'd like to get in there um i since taiwan was kind of high on my list i actually had a lot of why johnson i i wouldn't mind him going now um i i just think his he's such an offensive threat when he gets going um i think one of the things that's an issue with him as well as his size is that skating maybe if his skating was uh just a little bit quicker a little bit better it would sort of mitigate a lot of those times he gets pushed off the puck but the thing about him is his feet are always moving anyway and he does have that work ethic and he does have that kind of drive to go and do things um so i i think there's there's a ton of of offensive upside on this guy but it just depends how how many people are comfortable drafting a tiny little guy this high up yeah i think when i look at this and i look the guys are around him the the one guy that i go and i'm like man i i'd probably take him for sure above typhoid is billy coyvan and i know i'm a little bit higher than than even e2 is on him but i think we could probably slip him in here um maybe talk about dimitri costenco benjamin gujo or tristan lennox if we want to start getting into goalies again um it really depends so anyone have any specific guy they'd like to maybe shoe in there at 60 i like goudreau a lot yeah gujo's fun like i mean the thing that sticks out with me for goudreau is um his gaming he played against windsor one time last year and he had 54 saves and led in two goals and it was just this game where like windsor was just absolutely hammering him in and the way he was just able to stay composed make the saves move on to the next save and just do what he does and that like it was really encouraging he's um he's got a ton of talent um if i'm not mistaken he's yeah he's got good size for a goalie um he needs to fill this frame but every kid at this age does so um and he played on a bad team i think that doesn't get he doesn't get credit for the fact that he did play on such a terrible team like sarnia was rough last year and and he really was like the only reason they won on a couple of occasions so um i'd be fine kind of getting benjamin goudreau in there i think tristan lennox is probably going to be right in after him i like the idea of having those two together because um lennox does have a lot of upside and when lennox is at his best i do think he's better but i think benjamin goudreau is just consistently better so if we put benjamin goudre at 60 tossing linux at 61 seems about fair and then maybe we get into billy koivenin e2 would you uh be opposed to that around 62. no i think it's fine um i think second round is a bit high for him but it's barely second round so so i'm gonna ask you this then e2 him or alexi hamill selmy you can't ask that maybe maybe koi wouldn't okay because the thing is that he's really like raw and he's not the best skater or the most dynamic player but he's he's really smart and i really like how he he creates chances and it's it's really efficient and sometimes when you're watching garapata and you're you're wanting to see duham allah do great things and then the koivenant that just steals the show and the walmart is like a complimentary player of those two and uh that um so yeah i think that's a good price for him yeah i think like you said though there's so many times where i've been wanting to watch to amala and i noticed koivan and so i i think he deserves to kind of get into this range um the other guy i wanted to mention here is nolan allen uh plays out in whl he doesn't get a ton of love but i think he's one of those perfect examples of the guy that hasn't played yet and just getting pushed on boards um i know joel was huge on him um i i've watched a few of his games recently from last year just to kind of refresh myself and he reminds me of like just a guy that doesn't make a bad play like consistently um he he's of course he makes a bad pass once in a while but he's always on the right side of the puck he makes uh he makes up for it with his ability to kind of skate and get into the position so i think nolan allen's a guy that um he's not getting the love because he's not playing and once they kind of get playing out there in the whl and get 10 games under their belt people will start to notice them so um i'm going to throw him at 63 unless anyone has any objections to that i know the whole guys are really hard to rank this year because just like the ohl like they haven't played and for the whl guys they haven't really gone elsewhere to play for the most part so um outside of the ushl but nolan allen's a guy that he's a little bit young on on for the draft class if i'm not mistaken yeah he's eight end of april birthday it's almost a may birthday so um 63 seems about right for him and then that's where we start to get into the connor lockhart's uh red savage uh oliver kaepernick's in this range as well i would push for james malatesta in this range too i just think the speed is such a weapon the way that he's able to kind of just blow by defenders and he can separate quickly perhaps again i'm higher on him than most i don't know where braden's probably seen him play more than i have i don't know where you've got him at braden but i just think that the he's got like that water bug element to his game too he's quick and shifty he needs to kind of tighten up the the decisions where he just kind of fires pucks blindly sometimes but but i like the the tool kit there for for me with mel testa it's all about the speed yeah i i could be convinced probably nick um i think my concern with malatesta like like you say his speed is second to very very few probably in the league or in the class in the league um i find he's more of a straight line type of player like he can he he uses his speed up the boards and then um i find he's very reactive with the puck he's um rather than a guy who's thinking ahead of the play yeah i feel like he he uh yeah when he's forced forced to um i don't know maybe that's not the right way to put it but like uh under pressure he almost kind of panics sometimes and he just decides he's gonna fire the puck somewhere before he takes that look or has that mental snapshot of the layout of the zone and where his teammates are at yeah he definitely needs to improve that part of his game but that that being said well and at this point in the draft i guess if there's you know there's depending on what else is out there that what malatesta also does offer is is a pretty significant physical uh component to his game you know yeah even for a small guy yeah yeah i mean have you ever seen what he looks like without equipment on he he's stocky he's jacked yeah yeah yeah so i i think um yeah if you if you want a guy who you could hedge your bets with too again we were talking about someone earlier um with kind of the same same kind of security blanket so to speak he's a guy who yeah i i don't know if you'd ever see him projecting into a top six but uh i think he could be a good energy player yes absolutely good for checker um and and you know considering his size he uh he does does quite well in that type of a role um so like i i don't hate that idea yeah now one of the more interesting uh ranges that i saw on this list when i was going through them was from you at braden and it was isaac beliveau yeah he's been up and down and and for one point he was a first round pick at now there's a lot of people who don't rank him in the top 100 and you had him in the 60 to 75 range so yeah that's right about the range we're in right now so let's talk about him too yeah so i i don't know if it's a coincidence but the two guys who played with la fenier last year and thrived have been absolute roller coasters this year balduk and belleville but so since beliveau has moved over to gatineau um i find that he simplified his game quite a lot um he seemed very scatterbrained i don't know if it was a factor of not having a guy like laferniere to rely on to really um you know complete the plays in rimouski but um now in in gatineau i find that he's uh i guess they simplified his game he still has the strengths in terms of his his skating and his and his puck control he's a he's a pretty strong um player in terms of his ability to uh not react he uh or or react i guess he when he when he is put under pressure he's able to uh slither out pretty uh pretty well so i like him in this range i don't know nick have you have you watched bellaville at all uh just kind of in passing uh he's not a player i've really dialed in on a lot but the the one thing that the one negative with belivo that kind of stands out to me is i find his feet can be kind of heavy at times uh he's he's not all the time like you said he can be slippery on occasion but sometimes he's a little slow getting going from what i've seen i find when he has to pivot that's where he kind of falls apart a little bit you know in a defensive transition when yeah when he's forced to edge a guy out i find he he does lose a step on on guys pushing him to the outside his another thing is his decision making is not always the quickest but i find he has the mobility in his feet to buy some time so he can make a good pass up ice but coming back towards the defensive zone he does struggle a little bit i've seen a couple instances even in the games that i do really like him more recently i've seen a couple instances where still either he pivots and completely loses a stride on the attacker or he doesn't pivot and he he loses them he just kind of lets him you know go around to the outside so defensively i don't even know if um i would rely on him being able to improve that i i would kind of look at him in the light of a player who who that's that's what he is um and and judge him based on that for now at least i don't know if i would say well you know maybe he can improve that so we draft him you know based on his upside it is concerning for sure on on the defensive side of the puck but uh kind of reminds me of william villeneuve a little bit from last year yeah yeah either either villeneuve or poirier one one of the other that's kind of what i thought of last night actually too so um he's he does play more that style than uh than anybody else as far as defenseman though so you think he gets in this range then then uh guys he's a little bit lower for me i i'm not going to speak for braden but yeah no no i i like it like you say tony i bumped him up bumping down more recently bumped them up but um yeah you know what i'm i'm comfortable waiting maybe another 10 10 picks roughly we're at 63. like i i like his upside that being said um like like i mentioned i don't think you bank on him making significant improvements in the areas where he is flawed right now i don't think you can really take that risk i think it's a pretty uh yeah i think it's pretty significant yes i guess so um there are a few other guys i kind of have um around here from the queue i don't know um justin robot does it a guy that we've been up and down i'm not as high on him as a lot of other people probably um joshua i know we've talked about him in in the uh in the slack chat a little bit where are you out on cam why not brayden um i i haven't watched cam why not in probably a month um and more recently i came down on them but but i haven't like i said i haven't watched them kind of even even since nova scotia's returned here so maybe he's doing a little bit different than what i saw more recently so why not the player i really like i think he does good to kind of tighten up the gap in the neutral zone and sort of smother breakouts before they get going it's kind of rangy skates well for his size he's someone that i'd considered as a second round player and then and then some something along the line turned me off um i think i i think i felt like i saw inconsistent effort in some of his games but that's a guy i wouldn't fight you on at all actually right now is cam weiner so i'm more willing to get cam why not in here um but there is a couple of defensemen i want to try to get maybe ahead of them um and the first one is dmitry costanko and and he was a guy that um i've just really liked watching in general i'm gonna be completely honest uh dylan uh talk about him a little bit oh yeah he does a lot right he's a good pokemon defenseman um i've been watching him in his mhl games recently and i've been really disappointed with it um he's been a lot better in the vhl in the mhl which is weird it almost feels like at times uh he's just in a system as a pokemon defenseman playing on a team that says hey don't do that don't move the puck we want to play defense at all times we want to suck so when he tries to make these passes his teammates just don't know what to do because he's obviously a step ahead of them in the vhl and the mhl even uh vhl level as i discussed with uh svetchkov nobody wants to play hockey on that team uh so he's taking a lot of shots he's trying a lot of passes which uh with a normal player like on a fine team i'm not happy with the defenseman's shooting a lot but you know someone has to take the shots on that team and he has a really weird shot he when he does snapchat the his stick is like all the way above his head and then some um but he gets a lot of power behind it it's a pretty good shot uh on the power play he fakes it a lot and it always works because who's going to fake a shot like that and so it fools everybody and then he you know he's controls the and passes it so i was like a power play guy uh definitely a lot of value there um probably a really protectable um you know second pairing third pairing guy in the nhl just needs to develop and again totally out he's not a good team to develop on so there's always that question there maybe he gets traded maybe you have to sign him early but you know you kind of have to take their development into the into your hands because they're not going to develop with no khl team and when the vhl team is hot garbage yeah he seems like one of those players that might be a guy that like benefits from playing at higher levels with guys who kind of see the game at a higher level think at the same kind of pace as him to maybe take advantage of some of that puck moving ability that he's got yeah but there's still the issue that you know even if they're like the players in the vhl are more mature they're older they're men but it's still crazy how that they all think at a level below uh yeah these 18 year olds it's like how much help is he getting and it's not a lot so he's more error prone there's definitely uh unforced errors though so i can't like it feels like such a cop-out to just blame the team when there's definitely some glaring issues um but i mean he's needs to develop he'll need time he's older for this class he's been playing in the vhl all year yeah i the mhl games have thrown me for a loop with him but i definitely think there's still a lot there all right so the other defenseman i want to touch on here um was alexi hamill selmy and this might be a little high um e2 i know you and i are both huge fans of his game he's a ton of fun to watch and he's one of those guys i think braden mentioned it earlier with another defenseman where you look at him and you go he probably should have more points than he actually does because he does so many things well um including in the offensive zone like this kid's a ton of fun to watch so uh itu you want to touch on his game a little bit maybe yeah he's really he's uh excellent skater and he's got good hands and offensive skill is there but i i wouldn't say he's an offensive defenseman but he's a two-way defenseman who is more offensive than some of the others and he's a really good player he just struggled just a second i'll continue on with what etude was saying though he's not necessarily an offensive player he is a two-way player and uh this kid he just does ever he makes good decisions all over the ice and he angles off well defensively um he's not a huge guy so he's not going to go in there and like crush guys or anything like that but he does a good job of getting in people's faces and in using his stick to to break up plays off or defensively so um i'm a huge fan of his game uh e2 returned beyond uh him will sell me a few months ago now and every time i watch him i'm just like yeah this kid's good like you just sometimes you just watch a player in your log you're like there's something there like you don't know exactly what he's going to turn into but there's something there that um an nhl team's really gonna like yeah um he's uh and the one thing which has been good is that he has 10 points in the 10 games after the new year so he's get got more points and he's an excellent power play player also and um just i think he's a really good prospect i don't think he's going very high but he's he's he's a really good prospect yeah he's definitely one of those guys that i think where like i had him at 51 on my rankings which was great like really high and and that was me being extremely bold with him but like if he's available in the second round or something like at the tail end of the second round like this i think he's a pick i'd make i i don't know if nhl teams will make it but he's one of those guys that i think is going to go end up going later than i would take him and uh i'm willing to put him in here at 64 as long as e2 is uh willing to back that yeah so that's just that's all right perfect uh all right now we can get ty voigt maybe uh uh toss in at 65 because i feel like he is falling a bit and and we all do yeah we've re we recognize the skill like i said the biggest thing with him is just his size like if there was a magic potion to get him to grow two inches even like it would be fantastic and he might be in the first round but um dimitri costenko is another guy i want to get in here as well um i'll put him at 66. and then let's kind of get into guys like uh this is this is where it opens up a bit uh conor lockhart uh caitlyn i know you're allowed to put the full sun in now if you want to so oh okay i'll put him at 67. yeah i'll put him make it there this is yeah this is about that range where you start to really consider him so um claire though talk about connor sorry not claire caitlyn talk about conor lockhart a little bit yeah um colin walker is one of those guys that i really liked um coming out of miami um but i'm still kind of waiting for him um he he has all the tools his skating is absolutely fantastic possibly the best out of all oh his edge work is amazing uh he plays that kind of high energy style he has a high skill level um really really good skill good hands he's on the smaller side but i don't think i'm at too much because in skating you can get around that um i'm just kind of waiting to watch him i feel like he didn't showcase what he could do last year i felt like he was a little bit buried on that yuri team he didn't get a lot of opportunity so i'm still kind of holding off a sort of definitive opinion until i can see him play again but i do have him in this kind of 60 to 80 range i think i think the the tools are there it's just waiting to see what he can kind of put together with them now yeah i think he's a guy that we can probably put him in this range because i i don't think there's um like you said there's not a huge flaw in his game in any aspect so i'm more than happy to put him here um he he's got the tools right so it's it's certainly worth worth ranking him here um one of the players i wanted to kind of touch on and maybe sammy can touch on this is is martin reissavi he's not a guy that gets a ton of talk talked about a ton um but man like i watched a couple games of his recently and there's a lot to like with him oh absolutely he's just he's sort of a player you're big in third round give him three four five years maybe he and you get effective nhl whether it is where it is in your own of on your fourth line or on your second line or third line whatever it is on a different roles uh he can do that he can do all of that if you develop him correctly there's a lot of playmaking ability production isn't there on top level just yet but i like him i like him in this range especially when you we are in the range now where you just have basically one tool that might bring might get you to the nhl and if there is a guy here who has more than one he should be ranked and about now so i think he has uh his biggest strength when it comes to further development is uh versatility yeah and uh that's that's gonna be big for some teams now america i know you've seen him a couple times too so what's your take on russ savvy yeah uh i know just that he's really quick good at for checking and uh can be really physical and like sammy said he's very he can be versatile so that's his main point and i also know that he's really good at the international level i think he was also a captain uh yeah so i totally agree uh he's a really good player so well i think yeah i think i'm happy with with getting him in here right around now and giving him the prestigious rank of 69 and nice um yeah exactly thank you nice child and we're all children here um now we get into the range where we we can start to discuss guys like uh just so anybody like to be completely honest i know i did this last time with a ranking at that 90 where i'm like all right guys like start giving me names but this draft is really at that point now and uh the one name i do want to have a discussion about though before we go any crazy further and and this is the name that that we brought up earlier a couple of times and i can see mikael's face already and that's william stronggrin so i'm gonna start so i can get a couple positives out first um he's got a lot of offensive skill he's very very skilled he's got some good size um his skating ability isn't the best but he he gets moving um he he has a shot he has the skill um he to me he's a guy that you you draft and develop he's definitely not a guy that you draft and look for to to be on your team in two years or three years even um but there's a lot there like he's a guy that i think you could toss in and he comes comes over plays at the ahl level for a year or two and then kind of makes your nhl roster he's super young a june birthday um there's a lot to like about him but i know there's a lot of concerns with his game as well so now i'll let mikhail have the floor and get to some of that well i have to say i like williams i like him but i just see his he has a ton of skill and that's no doubt that he has he has his scoring skills of course but i think whenever there's not enough space for him to take the puck from like the defensive zone and start trying to and attack the if he doesn't have the space to do to use his hands then he doesn't do anything then he he stands along the boards and he doesn't help the defend defense to get the puck out of his own he he's a little bit he's just he's just a passenger and then in the defensive zone he's uh he's like uh practice code i think compared him to uh and he's got no more i i don't see that much like aggression in the game from him otherwise unless it's towards other players um what i think we should all look at is where does he score his points and he scores his points in the junior league and he scores his points in the swedish third division hope get them so i think just when he gets to space he's very talented but he's not going to get space unless it's in hokkien or the junior league that's going to get that's going to let him do what he does best so unless he changes that then he's going to he's not gonna go anywhere like he has a very high potential like he has a very high upside but reaching that upside is less than one percent maybe like in his and his floor is where he is at now he's in hope gesture like he's he's not if he if he doesn't reach his potential he's not going to be this third or fourth liner in the nhl he's not going to be an nhl player if it doesn't reach his potential so what i'm feeling is that you have to weigh his upside towards his the rest of his game and i don't think the rest of his game is worth enough to have him in the top 100 and i might be a little bit too harsh to have him do that like not having him on the draft court at all like he could be a seventh round pick i wouldn't i wouldn't mind that at all but i i just don't think he's gonna be an nhl player ever unless he hits that 0.5 percent or whatever it's gonna be like of his upset yeah i i know what you're saying and i see it all and and like i said i'm always the guy that swings on that upside right like i'm more than willing to swing on that upside um i we don't need to put him here at 70 or anything like that but i do think we we need to get him on the one top 100 board even if it's towards the latter half um because that the shot is good the skill is good and if he were an october birthday rather than a june birthday i'd have a completely different take on him that's what i was going to say tell me the the fact that he's so young for the draft class gives me a little bit of hope that he can get that stuff going and and maybe when maybe next year he plays at the else fence can level or gets up some some more shl time and kind of shows like that that little bit more aggression and shows a little bit more pace in his game and stuff because like i said the skill and shot is there like i think he's a good playmaker and maybe he doesn't do all that much at the nhl level and he's a really crappy third liner at five on five but i think he could do some things on the power play and in his draft class like there's a lot of guys that can't do anything on any at any advantage so um i think he's worth getting in here 70 might be a little bit too high for for the for the group and everything but i do think he should be on here but let's move on to to a guy that i think kind of doesn't get a ton of uh publicity really at all and that's vladisol lukaszewicz uh dylan i know i've seen your you've been a fan of him i've seen some games where i've liked him in some games where i'm like he's a guy but give us your take on him oh yeah um i've been struggling with him also as with everyone in this draft he just hates the defensive zone and that's his biggest flaw he pinches so hard to get just a crumb of possession and just never it's like not working enough and the last game i watched with him um he was pinching basically all game so aggressively and then getting caught out uh forward has to come back and play defense for him and then a third period's like his last shift of the game he has this perfect opportunity to pinch and i'm like okay he's gonna go do it and he didn't and he went back and played defense and his team got the puck and then they cleared the zone and they got the into the offensive zone like that so it's clear that um he can play defense he just doesn't want to uh but he's really good offensively uh his desire to get the puck out of the defensive zone really helps him out it's just the defense isn't there when he gets the puck into the offensive zone he moves it so well especially on the power play he's not spamming point shots he's uh more willing to get dangerous pucks to the net uh rather than just hoping for the best that he's just frustrating but so is everyone so it's kind of difficult it's just who's more frustrating and i think that i've seen a lot of him that's good but i just haven't seen enough of him growing throughout the year that's like made me want to bump him up super high so i guess this kind of 70 to 80 range is pretty much where i kind of sit with him yeah i kind of have that opinion too like this last range is going to be tough um i'm i'm going to put them in at 70 just for getting the name in there because this rest of this range is going to be tough to to kind of differentiate between um but the one thing i did want to say before we kind of start moving on is we've been here like four hours and i'm having a great time i'm having a wonderful time and i i know all of you love seeing my big bald head and i hate you [Laughter] i should have didn't know he was coming i should have muted him before i even started talking um but no what i was going to suggest is why don't we leave it at 70 for here now because we're just gonna keep getting into the weeds going any further right now this is gonna go in forever if we don't

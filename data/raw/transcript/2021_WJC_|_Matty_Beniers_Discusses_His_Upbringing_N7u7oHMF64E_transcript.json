  "full_text": "a year ago one of team usa's dress rehearsals for the world junior championship was an exhibition against the under 18 national team one of the stars that night was maddie veneers a strong-willed smooth skating forward who turned 17 barely one month earlier and proved himself against the nation's best in two older age groups for us was just a fun fun day i mean we get discovered the world junior team it's pretty exciting for us we didn't really expect much out of that game i think we just kind of went out there to work hard you know he's going to be a high draft pick coming up this year but most importantly he really fits this tournament well because it's a speed tournament he's got a lot of speed in this game maddie veneers has played with that pace and passion since his first days skating on the family's backyard pond in hingham massachusetts and that ranks near and far in the years since i remember saying this kid is why they have sports like hockey and football because he was he was just rough and tumble and you know big smile on his face every time he was doing that you know and you you didn't want to be stuck in a house with him christine and bob met as undergraduates at cornell where bob played football after christine earned an engineering degree broadway was her next stop not to watch shows but perform in them so you can imagine how christine and bob reacted when mattie told them he wanted to leave home at age 15 and joined the u.s national team development program christine an attorney moved to michigan with maddie and continued working remotely while bob who works in electronic sales remained in hingham you certainly want to give them every opportunity and not stand in the way the sacrifices have been worthwhile maddie could be the first american chosen in the 2021 nhl entry draft but not everything went according to plan amid the turbulence of 2020. veneers had planned to attend harvard 20 miles from the family's home but as the ivy league moved toward the eventual cancellation of winter sports due to the kobit 19 pandemic maddie looked for another option to play he found one in ann arbor thanks to an assistant coach on this year's world junior staff chris mayott reached out to us and and asked if we'd be interested and so that's we had a relationship with chris when he was at providence so we felt very comfortable with them i think we had known probably four or five years in and out of hockey race so we we jumped at the opportunity kind of fell on michigan and they kind of had everything i wanted they have the academics and the hockey and they were going to play and we have been able to play which which has been great so uh i kind of made that move and it's just been a really great experience so far michigan i tell them whenever we talk about these things like every hockey game that you play this year is a gift and i think it'll really make him appreciate every opportunity that he has to do that throughout this year and probably beyond maddie has enrolled in pre-med classes at michigan an ambitious path but perhaps not surprising for someone whose mother applied to law school while performing in a chorus line on broadway theater remains a major part of christine's life as a performer and instructor and yes she taught musical theater to her children gianna bobby and maddie i wasn't like the sound of music it's like a little bowl and i did some like jersey boys some scenes from the jersey boys so have you ever done any singing for your teammates very minimal we need some more sourcing on that one when he got to the usa camp there one of their first few meetings because coach appert he said he asked everybody to stand up and tell the team something about you that no one knows and maddie told everybody he he could sing and uh so coach africa made him sing on the spot and uh we all laugh about it now and he was telling us afterwards and i said why would you tell him you know i don't know being honest and then he made him sing in front of the whole team so yeah yeah mum was very happy yeah no he loves he loves to sing did you know what he's saying what his go-to song was when coach alford asked him to sing i think it was probably the jersey boys uh probably oh my gosh yeah it's on the wow you",

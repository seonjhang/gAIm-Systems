  "full_text": "[Music] H Sheldon in Harrison wat for FSU torch.com we're at David live Ice Arena here to preview Fair State's last regular season ccha series scheduled for March 1st and 2nd at the University of Michigan do you think of today's practice I mean getting ready for this huge Series against Michigan could you love me through what you thought of today's perform it's a pretty standard practice it was a good Tempo and uh granted we had a week off but just just pretty standard practice that week off really helped get you ready for this upcoming series when you had some injuries and also some illnesses to work through I think it's a good thing considering uh we did have a lot of injuries we still have a lot of guys still nursing some injuries and um granted it's really late in the season as well I think a week off help physically mentally maybe not so much cuz you kind to get out of that Rhythm but uh you know hopefully we use it for uh as a positive how imperative is this upcoming Series against Michigan for you in the ccha standings as this is the last series in the CC Chas uh well it means a lot uh it's we want to get home ICE obviously and uh if we win both games I'm pretty sure I think we lock it up and it's uh we like playing at home I think our our style of play is really geared to towards our home Rank and uh I think we definitely feel more comfortable at home and when you play Michigan it's they're a really good team you always want to bring your year after a lot of these people they've grown up uh Michigan kids they want to play for that team and when you play them it's it's uh it's just different it's a different type of game with this series being your last in the ccha regular season tell me what you are most proud of achieving at Fair State you know I I would say probably last year went the went in the CC season title uh I think that was just such a team accomplishment that we were're able to do and especially because you know this program's come such a long way in developing and becoming a a for contender so I think those are a lot of things definitely last year with the winning the CCH that was a really great experience and one I'll remember last year you're also ranked first in the nation for the first time in's history you just tell me more about you know how last year's performance kind of carried over for you and then to amp up the team well you know I I think I think personally gave gave everyone that was there last year confidence that you know we were we were like kind a force and a team to beat in not only the season but all college hockey I think when you when you get that sort of confidence it it kind of lingers that's a good thing so I think you know if you get in situations where it's tough you're down in a game whatever you can draw on past experiences and know that you have the ability to win games so you know I think that's kind of what I've tried to use and just try to lead by example knowing that you know what this team's capable of in the past you've talked to me about how that confidence also pours over into special teams um tell me what you'd like about your special teams against Michigan this season who doesn't necessarily have the best penalty kill in the ccha uh you know I think we've had a very good power play for uh for a lot of the year um I think the one thing that is kind of an unknown about migan is their power play now because the when we played the first time John Merl was hurt and he's obviously a big part of their power play so they uh they've made some adjustments you know they've moved turbo over so he can hit the onetime and he's got a big time shot so those are some things we have to work on the PK but you know if we you know with our power play we stick to our system and how we want to run things and you know hopefully we're going be successful who do you expect on your defensive line to uh really help curve Michigan's offensive ability high-scoring team well it's going to be great to have joh back you know it looks like he's going to come back in the play or come back in the lineup so you know we've uh you know I I would say that the other guys that play have played very well but it's definitely going to be nice to have him back there he's so so poised and steady and he keeps everyone you know uh kind of in sync back there at the PK so it's going to be nice to have him back in the mix I think he'll be a huge addition for us you know any uh do you know anything about Travis's current condition uh he's scared the last two days as far as I know he's been feeling good so you know we'll just go from there um Scott could you just tell me you're returning to the Bulldogs lineup this weekend against Michigan in the last ccha series You'll Play in a regular season um you've been injured for most of this season and how important is this series to you now that you're coming back oh it's very important I mean I'm the line we own we have our own destiny in our hand for homeless Advantage me getting back and do it is just to help me for playoffs um I'm going to put my best effort in hopefully help the team get out for the win we need both wins this weekend and we get home Advantage for the playoffs where do you want to be playing the most when you're on special teams uh from Special Teams I PK just get the Pu BL shots hard play I do what I can do break Puck out puck in that with the disbandment of the ccha looming can you just tell me what you see the future of this program doing in the WCC wcaa uh I feel like we could definitely be a Power House in that League we are in this league um there's not much to tell we haven't played much of those teams W cha uhan it's going be Olympic sheet most of the games which we haven't played much but I mean sure we can get used to it it's not that hard to adapt to it I mean I feel like we should be a Powerhouse I mean we don't know though any team we haveen played how excited are you to be a senior blue liner next year very excited very excited to get back hopefully uh stay healthy next season uh definitely want to have a good run rest of your year again just like hopefully get a good run this year like last year so here with CJ M hold starting golender uh CJ can you talk about um your ability to play the CL and how it helps both the offense and the defense I I think I think uh really faster we can get it in our hands the better so try to get out there and stop it that way we can get in our defensive hands uh that way we get as quick as possible and then also if they dump down on me I think it's uh kind of in the back of their team's mind maybe I can shot a stretch guy and they're changing um you played the most minut in CCA I think you're third in the country right now in minutes um can you talk about uh how you've been able to work um work weekend in weekend out uh without having any injury problems or anything and just being really consistently in the that for these guys I think start I'll started this summer uh I was here summer working out with uh the guys who stayed here in our Dave sensor drink conditioning coach I think he really got me uh in shape ready to play the minutes he thought that I might be able to play this season and then uh just uh you know getting my rest getting the right kind of stuff in me to make sure that I'm still ready to go out tip top shape every night um talked about Michigan pretty good offensive team here coming up uh how do you do you watch film for this or do you just prepare on the ice mostly for a team like Michigan and their offensive punch oh yeah we do a little video on them uh against their last weekend opponent but uh then again it's got to worry about us more than them you know it's got to get on the ice and PR what we do best and get hard work in and that way uh we can do what we need to do on the ice important week of practice coming up uh what do you uh what's the big Focus this week going into a big Series against Michigan um basically I think we just got to get playoff ready I think that uh this practice you know this week's got to be a lot of high-intensity stuff and um basically focus on you know getting our lights moving and getting ready for uh the upcoming series after that I mean you know you don't want to look ahead too much but obviously uh this this series also has a lot of stake um home the Home Advantage home ICE Advantage for playoffs so I think if we bring the playoff mentality into this series um you know whoever playing doesn't really matter I mean just focus on that as much as we can so that we'll be ready for the following one um as well and you know just play a good hobby how how important has the continuity of the Season been on the top lines you know for the most part you've had same top lines apart from a let being injured but how unimportant is that you talk about that for me um you know I think that's huge obviously uh you want to have guys that you know mess well together and when you have you know a line that's that's doing so and and putting out points and helping the team I think that's big uh obviously olette bonus are great players and definitely shows on the score sheet and you know in practice and everywhere um you know that definitely a big thing to have with Team here with Coach Daniels head coach the fair State hockey team uh first of all can you talk about um CJ's ability to play the puck and how it um you know I I don't think it's been talked about enough because especially in the western game you saw a lot of instances we played it really successfully well that's a great point you bring up and you know what we haven't explored all the Avenues we can use ability his he can really play the puck well and so can Charles Williams and I see it every day in practice and just as of late we've been trying to explore different ways to incorporate their ability to move the puck into our game plan and you know if you look at our our rink here uh the one odity we have is the way the boards uh our Corners are it funnels a lot of pucks behind the net so if we can find a way to incorporate our go tenders into helping us break the puck out I think it's going to Bod well for the future so uh we're trying and and I think we can open it up a little bit more as time goes on obviously big elephant in the room here is home I advantage in the first round of the playoffs and U Ohio State's already done their part by losing two games and a sweep guarantees home ICE how imperative is it to get it um especially for your guys being as beat up as they have been this season wow it's real imperative but you know what I I like is the fact that uh we set our goals like like steps and our first goal was to finish and get a Buy in the first so we a mission accomplish there our second goal get home I so that's right out in front of us third goal go to the Joe fourth goal win a championship so we've got the goals set out ahead of us we have the ability to continue to attain all these goals and while we feel comfortable if we were to go on the road I think we could win on the road uh in the playoffs it would be much easier to do it in front of our home fans and our students than it would be if we have to go on the road um most of the team has given me you know the whole while we're not looking forward to so I'll you know go one at a time here what's your focus for friday night's game especially well this Friday night like obviously winning because it's the focus but how do you get to that I think one of the keys defensively for us is going to be making sure we have a third man back I Michigan is so good at scoring on line rushes that we always want to make sure we have a third player back that that we're not giving them odd man rushes at our net the second thing is there's going to be turnovers but we want to make sure we know where that Puck's going to be when we turn it over you know if it for instance if we can't penetrate in the zone we're going to have to be willing to dump the puck in because if we turn it over in bad areas for instance in golf if you if you miss a hole or you miss the green a lot of your golfers out there will know then you want to miss it on the right side where you've got some room to still work with well the same thing here is if we turn the puck over when we do it we want to do it in such a way as we can get back defensively how important would a gritty game against Michigan be when it's going to be a war you know I think we're well prepared for it I it's going to be very difficult series and and it's going to be a battle but my God I look back the series against Western was was really a battle a Notre Dame Bowling Green I mean every series in the second half and more than I ever remember in the past it it seems to me like we've been in almost playoff mode since we played Michigan State to start the second half of the year and the reason I say it is in our League playoff positioning counts for so much fifth place gets you a buy fourth place gets you home ice so there's a lot riding on each position in the standings and I felt like this year as much as last you're going for the regular season title I felt like this year we've been on our game or having to be really on our game each and every weekend [Music] [Applause]",

  "full_text": "hello Kent Johnson hi cigaret Glenn it's really nice to finally make it to a history interview well we're so happy to have you we're going to ask you a few questions about your personal history okay and first question is how did you become a behavior analyst ah Funny Thing Happened on my way to a government degree at Georgetown University in Washington DC when I went off to college there to become uh someone like an ambassador for some I didn't know exactly but government was my uh my um focus and uh I uh uh had a math requirement to register for in my freshman year and I was given some options and asked to choose which option I wanted and uh uh there were two calculus options one was a standard lecture discussion recitation section Calculus class and one was a uh a class run by uh a method called the personalized system of instruction and that summer before I went to Georg I got a brief uh description of this of this style of teaching and it was very intriguing to me and I somewhat adventurous Soul so I said I'm going to pick that uh that PSI option so I got to Georgetown and I took the Calculus class and uh uh you know it was designed uh in units there were 20 units and you had to do an interview about the content and fill out a practice work sheeet for each of the units and you had to get 90% or better on the on the checkout before you could move to the next unit and you go at your own pace and there were all these other students who had been through the course present uh it was a very large class but it felt really small there were about 400 of us and it felt like I was in a class of uh you know 50 uh you spent time with Proctors who could explain the material that you read in the textbook or you and if you wanted to or you could do your checkouts and have a conversation about calculus and uh make sure you could uh complete all the exercises and moved to the next one and I was done by Halloween and I had my a and I was just just loved the the method uh and I asked the teacher the math teacher Barbara Reese I asked what Barbara where how uh did you invent this this teaching method and she said no the people over in Psychology you should go over and talk to them if you're really interested in it's Charles fer and uh and they'll tell you all about it so while I went over over to psych and uh and then I met all the behavior analysts that were in the department it was a psychology department so it wasn't all Behavior analysts but I did meet the several who were uh and uh you know next thing I know I'm a psych major so that leads me to my next question which is how what was it like to be a behavior analyst at that time and in that place well uh in the60s uh and we're talking 69 to 73 actually when I was in in college besides the the being in Washington DC during the uh Vietnam war protest which had its own level of excitement uh uh Opera conditioning uh was uh really the ascendant psychology at the time uh there was very little of what we now call cognitive psychology around uh uh uh there was so much literature uh it was an exciting time it felt I felt like I was part of a fairly new field uh whose major spokesman founder was still alive Fred Skinner he would come to campus uh Fred Keller who was the mentor of Charles fer and uh and later Gil Sherman uh uh they were all still alive and kicking and just uh convincing the world and you know and it was also an exciting time in the 60s you know we're all we're all we were all about saving the world so you know it was like Better Living Through behaviorism as uh dick mot would say on his bumper stickers he'd hand out you know to to students and uh and it was just an it was just a remarkable uh time in our field you're lucky to have been there at that time oh oh I'm so lucky so after you um after you completed your degree and you went on to your PhD at Massachusetts yes University of Massachusetts Amherst uh I remember I um uh was trying to figure out which of the five or seven or so Behavior Analysis oriented py departments I wanted to study in uh and really who did I want to study with with and so when I was a kid uh and I do want to get back to what I was doing when I was a kid that's related to this Believe It or Not uh I uh um was uh interested in getting back into uh working with children and teaching uh kids uh I had done a whole lot of research on PSI actually uh with people at Georgetown and later in graduate school but I did want to work with somebody who was uh uh doing this kind of work with children and psychology today came out uh with a special issue called the behavior Shapers at work and it was 1972 and psychology today as a magazine was very popular at the time it's still around you still see it at the at the uh the checkout counters and in stores and things but it really was was uh a big deal so I we all had subscriptions to that um and uh the behavior Shapers that worked uh uh had uh a description of 42 different Behavior analysts who were kind of in the top 40 plus two of people doing that work and I so I read each com it was a fabulous way to decide where to go to school uh and I read each of the columns uh related to each person and Beth Soler AAR then Beth Soler was uh uh one of the people described and uh I said you know she had been uh doing a lot of work in the token economy with children and she worked with children in inner city schools and children with poverty she was a actually had been an elementary school teacher in Harlem before she uh followed her husband into U higher at her her husband Ed Soler was a big behavior analyst uh uh as well and uh so I I went and studied with her I applied to UMass and I also applied to another big department was Kansas I really had a you know should I go to the University of Kansas should I go to work with Beth instead but I I finally picked to to work with Beth well you said a minute ago about your early interest in children uh leads me to my next question which is uh relates to your career that you did over time and of course it does have to do with working with children can you tell us how that came about uh my sister uh there weren't these diagnoses around uh that like there are today for children every child has some label or another these days it's a big industry of assessment and diagnosis uh there um and she really struggled and I mean she probably has a mild language learning disability or something if you thought about it in in the current uh Century uh but she was struggling with math so it's keeping orderly about the steps of arithmetic was just really a challenge for her so my mother asked me if I would help her CU I really liked school and uh I really liked math and we called it arithmetic then and uh I worked with her and we had a great time uh and she learned a lot of math and you know it really turned her her around her grades around in school and then other relatives uh in our family said well could you work with Andre my cousin and you know I started working with different uh different uh people in uh our family extended family and uh I come from a Entre background so everybody in my family does their own thing no one works for anybody and so I had that Spirit that's how I was growing up and so I said you know what I'm going to see who else in the neighborhood might be interested in this and so I made a flyer and I passed it out and I charged 10 cents a session and this was when I was nine and by the time I was 12 I had 40 kids and I did be come to my backyard and in fact the neighborhood that I lived in in Milford Connecticut the neighborwood was named Morningside so that's the name of uh our school now is Morningside Academy uh but the name comes from my childhood and uh and I would group them uh by their needs at different tables we had in the backyard and I'd recruit neighborhood children to help me with it with the job and so I built this little you know it's like Spanky and Our Gang or The Little Rascals or something and uh so so I was uh I just really enjoyed uh kind of a very primitive version of something like what we do right now at morning side so I'm very fortunate you know people not knowing what they want to be when they grow up you know I never had that I always had too many things to choose from and so I did go back to that childhood uh love that I had for working with children and helping them uh uh learn in school I remember being in second grade and seeing the teacher Miss Mrs mern would call on me and then move on you know and I said wait a minute don't call on me what about Stephen you know he isn't following this so I had this very this concern about people being left behind and uh No Child Left Behind and uh so all of that has really come to fruition for me and my um but now I have a technology of of Behavior Analysis to really make this uh this this shine so uh you worked pretty much all your career uh in at morning side developing it creating it developing the developing the technology and out of all the things you've done which have been many since I've known you uh what would you like to be remembered for what aspect of your work I'd like to be remembered as a a behavior analyst who was not um afraid or was really interested in looking outside of what Behavior analysts create uh and finding things that seem to be seem to work that exist outside of a behavioral framework and incorporating them with a in a translation of what that is know anything that's effective can be understood Behavior analytically uh and so I like to be known for the the uh a person who reaches out and brings uh other promising methods and curriculum into a behavioral framework uh to maximize what behavior analyst can do I mean we need to operate within the whole world as it exists and all of what's what's promising and not restrict ourselves to things that are only currently described in behavioral analect terms or created in Behavior analytic terms and I have to credit Charlie fer for opening my eyes on there I remember he would say it was all about translation he described Behavior Analysis as uh uh a microscope so he was a very metaphorical uh uh person he said behavior analysis is a microscope through which you view the world uh from this lens this particular lens so I remember one uh time he says we're going to read some Harry stack Sullivan you know Harry stack Sullivan he's one of those Disciples of Freud you know he's a Neo FR and yes we're going to read it because it's really a be if you read the psychiatric interview it's really behavioral so he was always saying you know it's really behavioral and you'd read it and be like well where is the behavior analysis and he said well then that's our land we we create the behavior analysis of it but it's really behavioral so I I really that was a a very important uh message that I learned as an undergraduate uh that has really uh uh suited me well in morning side so 1969 to 73 you were in school and since then you've been a behavior analyst for sure and the four years of graduate school so 77 I got out all these years yeah um how has Behavior Analysis changed since then how's it different or is it different well uh we we've uh as a field we've really been about the business of developing uh promising uh ideas that were generated back in the kind of the idea time I think of the 60s and 70s as our big idea you know the Big Ideas time and developing those into a uh a natural science of behavior and that's been a very important uh work it has taken our eyes off other big ideas and it has made us rather insular uh and I do always think back to Charlie about you looking outside and seeing what we you know we need to expand our our purview uh and include other po possible promises I so so I think that the field uh risks some things by being so insular I understand a science needs to be focused very focused so I do appreciate the focus but I do think that there's room for looking outside uh there's there's a man for example we have we brought a method in from a a cognitive psychologist named Arthur wimy who then decided he was well maybe I'm really not a cognitive psychologist maybe I'm a mental behaviorist he said uh he had a methodology called thinking aloud problem solving that we just have fully embraced it's so it's so scaran you know when you really it was very easy to translate that one and he really came along for the ride that's been a big breakthrough you know people say Behavior analysts don't do work in uh problem solving and creativity well uh we do we can do that work uh we haven't we haven't expanded ourselves to fully Embrace uh some of what other people in social science are interested in and but we could you know I I'm a I'm a I believe we could analyze everything in a behavioral framework so I'm not like a just a methodological behaviorists at all though there's a lot of methodological behaviorism that's running uh uh rampant now that I would like to see uh uh you know it takes a village we need people who are interested in parametrics and interested in methodologies and uh but we also need uh new ideas in our field and so just to bring talk a lot of problem solving into uh which is what we call it thinking a lot of problem solving talk a lot problem solving we teach the kids how to problem solve how to be able to figure out how to do what they don't know how to do without teaching uh because you know you can't learn everything that you need to be a successful person in school I mean it just couldn't happen in 12 years so you have to be able to be generative and you have to be able to take what you know and figure out what you don't know uh and it's really important to teach our kids how to do that because our kids need more explicit work in teaching them how to be successful uh in their lives it's the it's not going to be something that they automatically grasp with you know the struggling Learners that we do work with uh so I think that's uh uh that our field would do well to look at uh at things outside of our area and incorporate them we ought to be like the the Pacman you know we ought to be incorporating everything that is uh operative out there and successful we really should do more that so that's what I'd say sounds good to me if you had to to do all over again would there be anything in your historical path that you would do differently well uh you know I'm tempted to say uh I wish I wasn't so naive about business when I just launched into morning side at 27 with my Mastercard and my banker who had a child who needed tutoring who sympathized with me gave me a little money to get started I mean it was a long call in those 10 years so what I when I and when I think about what would I do differently the first thing that I think about is what can I offer to other Behavior analysts younger Behavior analysts and that would be some more um in uh instruction in how to start an opera business not to scare people away from it I mean I you know I'm if I had known what I really needed to know to be entirely efficient at running a a school I might not have done it it might have been a little daunting for me so I'm glad I had a little bit of uh impulsivity around it but uh but I uh I do I the first 10 years were a struggle and I I would do those differently but otherwise I think I would take Behavior Analysis to the streets I think that's that's my calling in this work I could have been a you know I love to ride I published lots of papers in graduate school I could have done the the university uh academic thing but I just think my my calling was taking it into the streets and helping kids so what areas of behavior analysis you do have a broad perspective and I think that this would be especially interesting question for you what areas of behavior analysis would do you believe we need more work in um I think we need more uh theoretical and conceptual work uh that's followed up with uh uh uh uh a a immediately followed up with a quest for uh making a technology uh experimenting with Big Ideas in a technological framework uh is uh I guess that's how I would I would capture what I'd like to see more of not just conceptual uh analyses uh but very pragmatically implications of those for on the ground work that we do uh you know U we ought to develop for example uh conceptual analysis the problem solving and creativity two areas that come to mind and immediately begin designing procedures based on those technology and immediately going to application uh in uh an experimental framework to verify what our conceptual analyses are you know it's what's on the ground you know I'm a big American pragmatist you know what's good what's true uh and what's good is what works and uh we ought to you know already there are conceptual analyses that kind of stay dangling in our in our body of uh writing in Behavior Analysis and we ought to be experimenting with how to uh how to bring those to uh the ground to the street level so looking into the future which is always hard but imagine sort of projecting forward and say what do you think Behavior Analysis would will be like it's let's say 50 years from now what where where do you think we'll be well we and so we want to F we want to look at where the culture uh more generally is going uh you know to help us focus a little bit uh as our uh Western culture particularly in America becomes more corporatized uh we ought to be looking at uh methods for uh running larger and larger organizations we ought to be uh doing good uh kind of behavior analytic work to uh make people happier uh and make organiza larger organizations more successful uh through Behavior Analysis so I I see that's one huge area and you know we do have people who work on organizational behavior uh analysis but they tend to work on organizational behavior management from the point of view of managers and they do also Tinker with micro uh contingencies that can be uh put in place in organizations I'm talking more about just working more with uh the contingencies at large in organizations and making them um more um like the whole analysis of leadership is really important as as our country runs uh in organizations that are larger and larger you know what is leadership and how you know in a behavioral sense you know the success of leadership is uh born out in the behavior of the followers of the leader and to focus on the followers and look at what how the lead how leaders influence followers and is that for good or not good and what those implications are for leadership I think those are that's an important area and and you know um looking at education uh as we grapple with larger and larger populations uh and you know a lot more people uh uh are in school now than they were when I was in school and so what does that have to what's the implication of that for how schools operate you know uh we can't you know so how does a teacher who is really faced with 30 or more kids now in a lot of uh cities in America how did that how how does it how does that change the the nature of uh of teaching you know how can we enlist the services of the children in the teaching of each other how can we make this more personalized uh from uh uh in how can we make schools more personalized and more effective back to psi yeah I really I do go back to that root but the implications of that for for children like we've developed this whole peer coaching methodology at morning side and uh and it's really has a lot to and you know these are't children that you'd pick out of uh of typical classrooms to be coaches of other children but what is the preparation for children like the struggling Learners that come to Morningside that that makes them very effective uh uh coaches of each other as we deal with larger and larger systems so you know you know when classrooms are as large as uh 40 or or more we really can't continue to use the the designs that we cooked up uh back in the day when there were 15 to 20 children in the classroom isn't gonna isn't going to work pretty soon we're going to get to the point where it's it's really we're we're really our schools are not really doing a very good job uh right now and so there's a lot of work to do in organizational analysis of that of schools so that's those are some of where we might go in the future okay so think about students out there and one of the reasons we're doing these interviews is we hope the students of the future will find them interesting uh about the history of behavior analysis from the personal standpoint of people who were there and who participated and the personal repertoire and histories and so forth but often we're called upon to sort of distill what we think is the most important thing we can hand over to a student what can we say to them that might might be something for them to hold on to as they proceed through in their careers what message would you like to give to students current and in the future learn how to be agile uh that's my current um my current uh Focus um how do you uh learn to adjust your uh Behavior to the constantly shifting contingencies that are occurring as uh America gets bigger uh how can you uh not get stuck in your Frameworks um how can you be agile uh how can you you quickly adapt to the changing contingencies that are occurring in your uh now in your school life and then later in your career life uh and not do it the old way uh because the old way is uh a different context than the new way so agility is a real is is a really uh important uh goal I think for our students in Behavior Analysis to to adapt to how can you adapt to the world uh and bring behavior and else along with you I think that's very important well thank you Kent that was most interesting I enjoyed it very much oh I enjoy it too anytime cigarette",

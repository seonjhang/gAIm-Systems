And Chris, I know you're about to head into practice shortly with Connor and the rest of the team. What do you think you'll say to him? Um, I'm not sure. Um, I'm going to see him in probably about 5 minutes there, right after this phone call. And uh, um, yeah, I don't sure. I'm sure he's a little excited and um, maybe a little bit relieved and now he knows where he's most likely going. So, um, yeah, we'll just see how it goes. What was your reaction when you heard that Edmonton had won the draft lottery? Um, well, um, you know, I didn't have any preferences where he went or I I think there'll be an excellent opportunity for him there and um um I don't know, it's a little bit ironic what's going on with our team and the Edmonton Oilers, but um, you know, I think wherever Connor is going to go, he will thrive and be a an excellent NHL player. Why is it ironic? Uh just with our uh our team, our financial situation of uh and um the transfer of ownership, what was almost happened with the Edmonton Oilers and uh now that our star player going to uh Edmonton, do you do you think Connor had a preference of where he would end up? Um I don't think so. I think uh maybe a little bit of being a a Toronto guy um growing up there, but uh I I I don't think he had a preference of where he went uh or any places that he had scratched off his list. So, um yeah, no, I think he's open to wherever he's going. Um he's kind of in the same situation being a 15-year-old coming into our league of you know not choosing a lot of players in the Ontario Hockey League sometimes choose where they go and where they not. Connor never done that and has no understood that it's part of uh hockey just to go wherever you're drafted and not be um particular what city you choose. What makes him a great player? Well, I think it's just his he has exceptional talents and there's players that can shoot the puck really well or stick handle and skate and have great on ice awareness. Um Connor, what makes him special is he's got all of that. And when you you put it all together, you get the the Conor McDavid uh product where he's just a exceptional hockey player. Do you think when people start saying he they compare him to Gretky, they compare him to Crosby, they compare him to Lemieux. Is that fair? Is that Is he in that league? Um I think he's going to be in an excellent hockey player and uh just to say he's the next um Sydney Crosby or Wayne Gretzky, I think it's really unfair. Um he's a one heck of a hockey player and he will be successful. So I think Connor will write his story and he will dictate of how good he's going to be. What's he like as a guy? He is a great guy and sometimes you get uh players with exceptional talent and have some uh um arrogance to them or feel that they're entitled to certain things and Connor is none of that. He's a team first guy, a player um who's just a perfect player to coach. Um where he's you have somebody who has exceptional talent, but he's a team first guy. The players on the team love him being around with him. He's one of the most popular guys, but he's he's cares about winning first and his performance second. Chris, good to speak with you. Thank you very much. Well, thanks for having me. Chris Knobblock is the head coach of the Eerie Otter.",

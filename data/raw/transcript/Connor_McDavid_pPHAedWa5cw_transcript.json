  "full_text": "Yeah, it's been exciting. Of course, um you always kind of uh had this uh this date mark on my calendar for a while. Uh you know, the comment is uh become a little bit of a tradition for uh you know, math eligible players. So, it's been a fun week. Did you have many interviews considering you kind of know what's going to happen here and Edmonton kind of knows what's going to happen. Did you have very many? Uh no, I didn't have too many. You know, more than one? Yeah. Does this the attention here, the amount of media cameras here? How accustomed to are you of this uh and and what is your impression of the attention right now? Yeah, I mean this is uh probably the biggest mediest SC I've ever done. So um you know, world juniors included. So uh this has been a big turnout and um I understand obviously with an draft it's a pretty big deal. So um it's kind of the last step towards that. So, um, it's great to see the the people come out. And Conor, it's one thing watch. Sorry, Conor. It's one thing to read everything about you. It's another thing to hear everything about you, but when you come in closer at the combine, now coming to the draft, do you feel like you are the best player in this draft class? Uh, that's not up for me to decide. Um, you know, I think a lot of people do a lot of talking and and uh, you know, they'll judge uh for their own eyes. Um, you know, I believe in my abilities and that's the main thing. But I feel I'm the best player in the draft. Um, I'm not sure. Maybe you'll hear a different answer from Jack, but um, we'll see. Did you watch or pay attention to him during the year? Did you watch it? No, not too much. Um, obviously you just got to worry about yourself and and make sure you're handling your own business and um, you know, you're ready to go each and every night. So, um, I thought I did a pretty good job of, uh, you know, not letting it get to me. Do you welcome the comparisons to Jack, though? You welcome that kind of it might be a rivalry in years to come. Yeah, I think uh, we'll be linked together for a little bit here at least. Um, you know, it's uh been good. Have you Have you noticed how life is beginning to change? I mean, this is this scrum, this is probably not going to be the last time you have a scrum of this size in your career, even in the next couple of weeks. Uh, yeah. Um, getting more and more used to it, of course. Uh, been dealing with it for a little bit now. And, um, it's something I like doing. It's fun to to do this. And um you know obviously uh I like to play hockey more than than this stuff but you have your responsibilities and and um you know it's it's a good problem to have. You got to know Jack at all. Have you gotten to know Jack at all? You said a few months ago you really didn't know at all together this Yeah, I got to know him a little bit better. Um you know it's been interesting obviously uh you've been linked together for so long now. You start to feel like uh you know him and um it was good to finally meet him and get to know him a little bit better. What'd you find out about him? This is a nice step. What's the value of this combine for you? I mean, if if it really is almost predetermined where you're going to go, at least from our perspective, what's the value in testing for you? Uh, not to embarrass myself, uh, Bennett tweeted me today, said, uh, watch out for that pull-up bar. So, so, uh, so of course I I don't think, uh, I want to get zero by any means, but I mean, you look at a guy like Sammy and, um, you know, what an unbelievable year he had, uh, or at least finished the year he had in the playoffs. I think, uh, his, uh, his combine experience is long gone for or forgotten. Hey, Connor, going going back to the the day of the lottery, it was hard to read your reaction, so I figured I just ask you about it. I don't know if it was like shock. Yeah, it was more like it was Have you been asked about that? Like it was uh once or twice. Wasn't exactly elation. Yeah, once or twice I've been asked that. So, um yeah, it was more just shock than anything. Uh you know, kind of for a couple years now. It's it's been, you know, you're expecting one thing, you're told one thing, this is going to happen, and then in a whole instant it's not the case. You know what I mean? So, um it was uh an exciting day. Um I was more just shocked than I think. Have you accepted the possibility that Edmonton will be your land? You know, likely land. We'll take this last question about the lottery and then we'll move on. Very good. Okay. Um Okay. Um yeah. Um yeah, I mean uh there's nothing to accept. If it's Edmonton, it's great. I mean, I'll be so happy if it's Edmonton. If it's not, then it'll be great as well. I mean, it doesn't really matter. Everywhere is great in the NHL. Last year spent a lot of time around Aaron when he went through this. So, what did you learn from that experience and how does this compare to that? Um, you know, I obviously am very good friends with Aaron and and both Sams and um it was a lot of fun for me just to kind of follow along. Was more of a fan last year and um of course kind of asked them about their experience and they said obviously come draft time it uh it ramps up a bit and you know they're more than right. So Connor, you've been a teammate of Dillings now for for a couple years. What can you say about him as a player? He's unbelievable. His hockey IQ is off the charts. Um, you know, what he's able to do in in terms of finding people with the puck and um, you know, making great passes. Um, you know, it's it's so fun to watch. Um, um, I' I often times find myself just uh, you know, kind of watching them when I'm on the bench and, you know, a guy like that you can always uh, you know, learn some stuff off of. What kind of questions did you get from teams other than Edmonton in the interview process? Uh, all very straightforward. Nothing too uh too particular. How many other teams other than Edmonton did you meet? Uh, a couple. Any test that you're kind of looking forward to tomorrow? Uh, I'm not sure if you you look forward to the the tests, but I mean it's it's it's going to be fun. It's going to be exciting. And um, you know, it's always a new challenge. So, uh, it'll be interesting. Wherever you can perhaps go. You mentioned this is kind of the last step before the draft. Are you grateful for that that it's kind of coming to an end here? Uh no. It's something that you kind of want to save or um you only go through the draft process once. Um it's something that uh been looking forward to for a long long time now and um you know it's it's going to be obviously so happy when you get drafted, but um you know that's kind of when the hard work starts. Um, you know, there's no uh no more junior life or or anything like that if I'm lucky enough to to move on.",

  "full_text": "Connor, you were granted exceptional status about two and a half years ago. Has the time flown by to this year draft year or has it been a case of finally it's here? Uh, a little bit of both to be honest. I mean, looking back, I can't believe how how fast it went, but then you also look back and and realize, you know, all my friends are now drafted to the NHL and a lot of them signed and, you know, a couple of them will play there. So, it's uh you know, time is is it's been some sometimes it's flying, sometimes I mean it's just standing still, but uh you know, I'm I'm really happy it's it's finally here and um it's it's been a good couple years, but uh you know, I'm really looking forward to you know, my draft year. I know when you were six years old and you desperately wanted to play rep hockey, but they wouldn't let you do it. That your mom sat down with you and drew a sort of a staircase and each step represented one game left in the house league that you were playing in and that was sort of to get you through and realize that thing you haven't had to do anything like that to get to your draft year. Uh, no, not a whole lot. I mean, uh, grown up a little bit since 6 years old and and the staircase is kind of not so much, but, uh, it's, um, yeah, it's been a great couple years and and I'm really, you know, happy that, uh, it's finally here and and have the opportunity to, you know, prove myself to to maybe be the first overall pick. I interviewed you a year ago and you were talking about your first year in the OHL that I think you said you felt like a little rat that because you were so so thin and you weren't very strong compared to the the older kids and you noticed a big difference in your second year. You're now entering your third year. How much more stronger and faster do you feel this year than even last year? I actually think that, you know, the the jump from my second year to my third year has been even greater than than my first to my second. Um, you know, I've I've put on, you know, a little bit of weight. I'm I'm taller and um you know I feel I feel really good. So um it's it's certainly a little bit different when I was 15 years old about 510 160 soaking wet. So it's uh it's uh it's it's been a good couple of years. What's your exact height and weight right now? Uh be about 61. We'll say 61 and uh about 190. You've always been a notorious goal setter. You've you've always set very specific goals for yourself. What are your goals for this season? Uh I have a couple personal ones that uh you know I don't think you know you guys need to know about, but I mean obviously one of them would be um it'll be the first overall pick. Um you know play on a world junior team again, win a you know a gold medal and and an OHL championship and then you know maybe Cup. I mean those some pretty pretty lofty goals but you know I think you know the team we have in the area it's it's very possible and you know the the group of talent there is in in Canada I think the gold medal is possible as well. So um you know I don't see why this year can't be you know anything but you know special. Do you think you'll look at the NHL standings more this year or more precisely maybe look at the bottom of the NHL standings more? Maybe a little bit but um you know you just got to worry about yourself. I mean, uh, you know, they say you could be the first overall pick, but there's there's such a, you know, a good draft class this year, and, you know, the list goes on and on. So, you just got to, you know, keep working and and make sure you're uh you're staying at at the top of your game. So, I saw some comments from you where you talked about, you know, when you're draft if if someone's drafted number one overall that you just go to the team that drafts you. And I mean, when you were drafted number one overall to Erie, a lot of people wondered, would you report to Erie and that you had some pretty strong comments about that? How what's your thought on that? Yeah, it's pretty upsetting. You see it more at the OHL level and I think it's it's just wrong to be honest. It's um you know, you put yourself ahead of the game and it can never be like that. I mean, hockey is a is a pretty special game and and we're all lucky, you know, to to be able to play in it and and to put yourself ahead of the game and and, you know, select where you're going to go, it's it's not fair. I mean, there's a draft for a reason and the team picks the best available player or the team that, you know, the the player that, you know, suits them best and um, you know, for the player to to say, I don't want to go there and, you know, I only want to go there, it's it's it's not right. this draft has been built, the Conor McDavid draft or Conor McDavid versus Jack Eel. When you hear that sort of stuff, what do you think about that? It's pretty special. It's something that you grow up to to put yourself in this, you know, situation. I mean, that's that's why you work hard and and um, you know, have a have a good couple first years. It's it's all about, you know, putting yourself in a situation like this and um, you know, it's just, you know, it's got to stay the same. You got to keep working hard. You got to keep doing your stuff to to stay at the top or else, you know, someone's going to knock you off. So, do you take it as a a personal thing in terms of a competition between you and Jack Eel? No, it's not personal. It's uh it's about going number one. It's not about beating Jack Eel or Noah Hannathan or Dylan Stro. It's it's being, you know, the number one overall pick. Have you had any head-to-head history outside of last year's last year's World Junior with Eel? Because I know he's a a late 96 birthday. you all you're 97, but you always played up. Did you guys play each other in minor hockey growing up? I never really came across his name in minor hockey, but uh I think the first time I saw him play and played against him was at the U7 tournament and uh we had an absolute shootout in the U7 tournament and uh I think we went back and forth and I think the final score was 4-4 and we ended up going to a shootout and you know they they won the game. So, but uh you know, we kind of went back and forth, but uh you could tolerate from there that he was he was a pretty special player. You've seen him enough at World Juniors and U17 and that to probably give us a pretty good scouting report on him. What would Connor scouting report on Jack Eel be? Yeah, he's a good skater. He's a powerful skater. He's he's a big guy. He can shoot the puck. He likes to shoot it. Uh he loves his tow drag and and all that, but um he's a great player. I mean, he could score. He can pass. He's he's a big guy. So, um you know, there's not a whole lot he can't do. In some ways, you probably have more in common or more familiar with the guys that got drafted last year because those were the guys you you played against in minor hockey all the way up. Yeah, I could probably tell you, you know, anything you need to know about last year's draft, but I couldn't tell you a whole lot about this year's draft. Um, you know, except for the local guys and, you know, some of the higherend talents that that everyone's been talking about. So, uh, really know a whole lot of people and and you know, the the events like the the, you know, CHL top prospects game will be a little different. Might be the the loner outside looking in. I mean, don't really know a whole lot of guys. So, um, but, uh, you know, I'm looking forward to the pressure and expectation level is is is enormous and that and and I think you you obviously cope with that and and deal with it and that. Does it ever get to be a little bit much? uh it can be a little bit much at the beginning of the year when all the pressures of the start of the year and all that that stuff can can kind of add up, but once you find, you know, your rhythm and you get into a groove and, you know, a routine, it kind of all goes away. And um I'm pretty lucky to be up in Eerie. I mean, there's there's not a whole lot that that goes on media wise. And so it's um it's it's not too bad. That's probably been a blessing, hasn't it? playing in an American I'm sure the Otterers are big in Erie, but if you were in a a Canadian city, I would imagine it would be ramped up that much more. Yeah. Yeah. Playing in Erie has been, you know, an absolute blessing. And um you kind of get hidden hidden a bit, but you know, up there it's all about the otter and it's not about one player. They just love their team and um so it's it's it's great. When the pressure builds, is there is there a particular way that you take refuge from that or you diffuse the pressure? Um, there's a couple things I do that, you know, just our personal stuff and and you just kind of get back to the basics. You know, you just work hard, practice. That's that's the main thing. Once the when times get tough, you just got to bear down and and, you know, get back to the basics and and do everything that, you know, got you there and and it'll all work out. Pressure ra amps up even more because of the World Juniors. And this year it's in Toronto, Montreal, which takes it to another level. And there's a New Year's Eve game. Canada, United States, McDavid, Eel. I mean, it it'll get even crazier than it's been, I would imagine, at any time in the last number of years for you. Yeah. And uh you know, it's a pretty big storyline, I guess. I don't know how they how they wrote that one. But, um, it'll it would if if I'm fortunate enough to be able to play on team Canada and, you know, he's playing on the American team and and all that stuff, it uh I know it'll be a pretty pretty crazy game, but um, you know, the the World Juniors being in Toronto, Montreal is is a dream if you're be if you're, you know, forced up to be able to play on that. It's it would be just crazy. When you were a younger kid, I'm assuming you watched the World Juniors on TV. And do you have any memories, specific memories from that, especially New Year's Eve games against the Americans? Oh, of course, of course. I every boxing day, you know, watch first game and New Year's Eve. I mean, I I watched them all, but uh I don't know, probably like a favorite memory would be obviously Everly's, you know, 5second left and Gord Miller with the great call and all that stuff, but uh also, you know, Tavvaris's hattick, New Year's Eve hattick, you know, the Canadians got down pretty good and and he just kind of put him on his back and and you know, won the game, you know, for them. But, uh that was a pretty special of a game for him. How hard was it last year with the team not getting a medal and and maybe the tournament not going the way you would have liked personally? Yeah, it uh obviously it wasn't a storybook ending to the world, you know, your first World Juniors, but uh it was a good experience to be able to play at 16. It's it's just an honor to to be able to put the jersey on, let alone, you know, make a difference and and not a lot of guys made a difference at 16. Obviously Crosby and and Tavvarus did you know a little bit but um you know for the team wise I I don't really know what happened just we had all the talent in the world but just you know never really came together and I think that is a good lesson you know for for the guys who you know are able to to represent Canada again. It's it's all about coming together as one. It's not about being the best team. If you look on paper I don't think Finland was the best team. I would say, you know, they they probably on paper they shouldn't have won, but you know, they were they were a great team and that's that's the main thing. They were a team and and uh you know, they ultimately won. So, you're off to a great start in the uh the 08 your OHL season. I did notice, however, that after three games, you've got two minor penalties already. You were the three three minor penalties. You're you're uh in danger of not winning the sportsmanlike player award. Yeah. Yeah. My dad my dad said uh you know he didn't want the sportsman like so he threw it away early I guess but uh just kind of how it works actually they came in all in one game and it was just uh couple bad balances. One was you know just getting a little angry with with the guy and um it happens I guess but um yeah the sportsmanlike comes again it comes again but if not you know it's it's whatever. You've never had a fight in the OHL. What would it take to make Conor McDavid angry enough to drop his gloves? Uh, I don't know. I don't know. Actually, Joel Wigle just had a fight in in a 7-1 game and broke his hand and and he's done for about three months. So, that kind of said made me say, \"H maybe maybe fighting is not my thing.\" But, um, you know, if maybe if uh, you know, someone took, you know, a good run at, you know, one of the younger guys or was taking a good run at me, then, you know, maybe I have to take exception. Your uh, your family has been very important to you. I I know that your dad coached you through much of your minor hockey. What What's the best lesson that he's ever imparted to you? Uh the best lesson he's probably ever taught me was um you know, he always said that if you have a goal, make each and every day count towards that goal. And you know, I try and do that. I mean, each and every day it's about getting better and and all that. And um you know, he he did a great job instilling, you know, hard work in me and and all that stuff. And um you know I've I own you know everything. Uh your mom Kelly um I would describe her as not a hockey mom. I mean I think she's she told me before that if you if all the kids if you and your brother Cameron had decided to be skiers when they were when you were four or five years old she would have been just as happy and that what what what's your mom mean to you in terms of handling your career? She's probably one of the most important people to be honest. Um, and although she wants to be a skiing family, um, she she does just a great job of keeping the game very secondary. She just makes sure that, you know, all the mom stuff, I'm sleeping right, I'm eating well, taking care of myself, and I'm not getting sick and all that stuff. So, uh, you know, she does a great job. You got a brother, Cameron. He's four years older than you. Um, I know he's very proud of you and you get along very well, but an older brother must have been some times where he's given you the gears pretty good, too. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. We always used to play a road hockey together and for some reason it was always me getting hurt and uh I couple stitches, you know, couple very close calls. Stick came right up here. Almost lost my eye, but uh it was uh you know, he's he's great. I mean, he uh, you know, you think there might be like a little bit of jealousy, you know, with an older brother and his younger brother, you know, gets more attention than him. It's it's and it's not like that. He's he's a great older brother and, you know, he's not doing too bad for himself either. He's, you know, an Ivy student in Western and, uh, you know, he's doing great things there. So, uh, I know that Sydney Crosby's a very superstitious hockey player. On a on a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being Crosby, like superstitious, how superstitious are you? Say probably an eight. An eight or nine. I'm a pretty superstitious guy as well. Um, couple crazy ones that honestly if I told you, you would think I was absolutely insane. Let's hear Let's hear. Honestly, I have no idea. It's just uh You get dressed a certain way every time, correct? Of course. Of course. Get dressed a certain way. Uh, one that I always get the gears for is uh my warm-up shoes. My warm-up shoes have a hole at the top and you know my my toes coming out the top and the whole bottom is just torn right out. But uh you know I I joke they're they're my like mics cuz uh I wear them uh I've worn them since I was I was a little guy. So uh what about uh I I think some of your underwear that you wear too is Yeah. Yeah. Actually, uh there was a pretty bad incident last year before one of the games. You know, I have my uh my lucky underwear and and they get pretty torn and ripped and all that stuff and there was it was before a game and uh Nick Betts just jokingly or whatever and uh you know, we got into a little bit of a wrestle before the game and all of a sudden my boxers just just ripped right in half. Couldn't wear them anymore and I was pretty upset with them for a bit but uh you know I had to find another lucky pair of boxers. We joke about it, but do you ever worry that superstition becomes an impediment that your lucky underwear and you have a bad game because of it that you become a slave to that superstition or can have a negative impact? Of course. Yeah, you can you can often times, you know, get lost and and your superstitions and all that stuff, but I do I do a good job of keeping them, you know, pretty light and and they're not they're not stupid stuff. or kind of just more of a routine I would say and and all that stuff, but um you can get lost in them for sure. How much preparation goes into getting your stick ready for a game? Actually, I am probably the the last guy to to you know, I I don't spend any time out at all. Most guys get there and and the first thing they do is they tape all three sticks. And taping my stick is actually the last thing I do. do, you know, my warm-up, then I I go get my sticks. And I actually just tape the one, the one I'm going to use. I just tape that one. And um, you know, my equipment manager always hates me for it because I'm always the last guy. He's always, you know, breathing down my neck to to get my spares in on time and stuff, but uh, he does a good job of of understanding, you know, my my kind of time period. So, all right. Thanks for doing this, Connor, and good luck this season. Thanks a lot.",

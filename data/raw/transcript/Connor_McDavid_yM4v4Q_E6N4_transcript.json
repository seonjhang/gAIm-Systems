  "full_text": "Patrick came to this. He met Snoop Dogg. Are you Is there something you're looking forward to? Uh I don't know. I mean, uh just looking forward to being around it. I mean, uh it's obviously really exciting to be here. Um I don't know. It's just exciting to be here and be around the guys, I guess, and enjoy this experience. It's kind of cool to be around the Stanley Cup, though. Of course. It's kind of hockey versus just Of course. Yeah. I mean, uh, I've never never seen a live Stanley Cup game, so I'm certainly excited for that. Um, obviously this kind of gives you the behind thes scenes look at, you know, what they're what they're doing to get ready and all that kind of stuff. So, um, I just try and uh, soak it all in. Does your mind start to wander and think whether it's next year or the year after that this could be you playing in uh, a playoffs or Stanley Cup final down the road? Um, I don't know. I mean, just that's a little bit far down the road. I mean, I'm just looking forward to the draft and hoping uh obviously uh can can get drafted and um I just hope to play at at some point some. Who are you most looking forward to seeing live at the game? Uh it's pretty hard to pick in a game like this. I mean, you look at the guys, the long list of talent, whether it's uh Patrick Kane, Steven Stamco, Tyler Johnson, Taves, I mean it uh the list goes on and on. So, I'm just excited to see some uh great hockey and obviously I've been watching it on TV and uh looking forward to seeing what it's like live. You ever met any of those guys like Patrick or Steven? Uh I know uh Stam Coach just a bit through uh working out and uh we work out at the same gym, so I know him a bit through that, but um I've never really met any other guys. Do you have any from Sweden, so it's a corny question, but if you had any Swedish favorite players Uh Matt Sundine, I think just being a a Toronto guy. Um you know, he's kind of a guy that I looked up to obviously being from Toronto and and watched him every Saturday night and uh you know, he's unbelievably did everything right and uh just seemed like a great player. How much of a whirlwind has it been the last four or five weeks from the lottery to the final to the CHL awards and now this? Yeah, it's been crazy. It's been a very busy uh couple of weeks and um but it's exciting. It's where you want to be. It's a position that uh every guy wants to be in and I'm very lucky to to be in that position and uh just looking forward to the next couple of weeks and uh you know ultimately get into the draft. So, what does the rest of your summer probably look like? Cuz I imagine you're looking to step into the NHL this season. Yeah, I mean uh just a lot of training obviously. Um just trying to get bigger, stronger, faster, all that kind of stuff. So, you know, a big summer ahead of me and I need to get uh like I said, got to do all those things. Is it a realistic expectation for yourself that you can not only just step into the NHL, but start to make an impact or what do you think that growing or that learning curve is going to be like? I think uh there's going to be some growing pains for sure. I mean, I don't expect to step right in and uh you know, be uh be that guy, I guess. I mean, um you know, it's a it's a much different league. It's it's going to be a lot harder. So, I'm just looking to do what I can in terms of, uh, you know, getting better and working hard this summer and, um, come in and, uh, try and, uh, you know, make the team if I'm lucky. And, um, if, uh, if that happens, then I guess we'll see what happens from there. What was your interactions? What were your interactions like with the Oilers at the combine last week and getting to know those guys a little bit? Yeah, it was it was fine. I mean, uh, went well. I mean, it was a nice meeting and I know it was cool to get to talk to the guys and see all the guys and um just kind of get to talk to them and and meet them a bit more. Was it the evolution of sinking in that this is actually happening? Moments that you just kind of this is real. This is your Yeah, I mean it's it's a dream come true like I said. I mean, last week is the combine and um you know, I remember looking back last year just wishing I could be a part of that and um you know, and now all this is happening now and um you know, it's been a whirlwind and um you know, like I said, it's been a dream come true. So, I'm just trying to enjoy the experience and really looking forward to the draft there and couple of weeks. You said you hadn't met Jack at all. Has the last week or maybe this kind of trip changed that get to know him a little bit? Yeah. Yeah, for sure. I mean, I met him uh at the combine and kind of hung around and uh you know, obviously uh you know, this trip, we're a little bit closer. So, um it's been good chance to get to know him. How much have you kind of studied or looked at the the Oilers roster and just maybe even kind of imagine that I might fit in with this guy or um not too much to be honest. I mean, um I'm not drafted there or anything like that. So, um, I guess I'll do that a little bit more if, uh, if that's where I'm drafted. Have you had any if Jordan or, uh, Taylor, I know they reached out to you right after the box lottery. Have they Have you had any other? Uh, no, not really. But, uh, Teddy Pcell actually works out at, uh, Gary's gym and, uh, same with Derek Roy. So, I kind of see them around a bit. You think that'll if you do go to anything, you think that'll help having guys that went first overall as well? obviously in the same position. Uh yeah, I think so. I mean, uh they've been through it. They understand the position. So, I mean, whatever advice they have, uh you know, will obviously help.",

  "full_text": "all right for the first of what i am anticipating to be many discussions about the nhl draft it is our director of scouting mr craig button craig second time in four years the sabres will choose first overall they took the dalai lama rasmus daleen last time he is a defenseman looks like they're going to take another one in owen power this time does he fit with the sabres need well here's what i would say about owen power jay is is that he fits what any team needs a top-notch defenseman that can control the game and have command in every single situation we watch victor hedman play with the tampa bay lightning and the way the defensemen play in today's nhl they play forward and they play with a real initiative in terms of making sure that they're not backing up and on their heels well that's how oman power plays listen victor hedman's unique i'm not saying that owen power is like uh victor hedman but in terms of his ability to control the game and all its critical and essential areas it is outstanding i call him the s man for superb sense strong skills and superior size and he combines all of those elements into a player that can do so many different things in the game and if you're a coach and you have owen power on on the ice you have comfort you have a real sense of calm because you know he has things under control when he's out on the ice i mean you said it craig the sabers basically need everything so this guy is going to help no doubt about it now that you have the canucks taking forward kent johnson out of michigan at nine you have the sends taking forward mason mctavish at 10 and you have calgary taking cole sillinger at 12. why do you feel those players are particularly good fits for canada's three non-playoff teams craig and i'm really happy you said that why are they good fits listen i don't know who the teams are going to take i look at the draft i try to assess it based on you know what players could fit at certain team style what players i think could be available and that's where i go from there but kent johnson is is a really creative imaginative center and he he plays the game with the same type of mindset as elias patterson in fact jay you know physique wise he's very similar to elias patterson at the same stage but his ability to to make things happen out of seemingly nothing he's got great confidence with his hands he handles the puck in traffic he doesn't shoot the puck like elias patterson but he's got a sneaky good shot you can't sleep on him when he has the puck and think he's just going to pass it because he can score goals and an essential requirement to play in the national hockey league is the ability to operate in tight spaces and kent johnson does that exceptionally well mason mctavish is a good strong two-way center he's got a good shot he can score but he's got a real fire and determination in his game and a real good strong two-way component dave barr who coached him at the u18 championship where canada won a gold medal said he plays the game like ryan o'reilly that's pretty darn good you'll take ryan o'reilly on your team and certainly that type of player and for the calgary flames cole sillinger he's not going to dazzle you he's not gonna wow you he's not gonna make the highlights on sc with jay at midnight but i'll tell you what he's gonna help you win a lot of games he he's got great sense for the game he understands you know what play needs to happen anywhere on the ice he's a great competitor he doesn't allow himself to be denied and you know i guess the only thing working against cole sillinger going to the calgary flames it was one of the very few teams that his father mike didn't play for so mike doesn't have a calgary flames jersey to pass on to his son i will say this you love to have that pedigree though don't you you just love it there's something magical about that and i'm sure calgary would love to get him first round of the draft by the way goes july the 23rd so lots of time between now and then for us to continue to talk to craig about the draft craig thank you you",

  "full_text": "all right first we have coach Bob Daniels coach could you please give us your thoughts on tonight's game sure um it's a really uh very similar to a lot of my thoughts have been for a lot of the games lately um from the standpoint that you know I'm happy to see the goals go in I'm concerned that we're giving up so many scoring chances against um really happy with how CJ M played tonight I thought he was worth his W to Gold tonight uh the other thing is for the second game in a row we came back for a two goal deficit early now good news on that is we're showing some resilience and some toughness the bad news is we're falling uh down by two goals early so um you know we'll we we'll hopefully continue that resilience but maybe uh find a way not to be playing from behind uh so much in the future Dan coach talk a little bit about the power play here tonight going two for three on the night as well as the penalty kill going one for five tighten it up after that the first period yeah definitely really uh happy with the penalty kill I think they scored on their first Power Play and I was disappointed with that I again it's just something to have to look at but I thought um the first minute and the half did a terrific job of killing and then we kind of leak a little oil was nervous after that uh but the guys really I thought did a terrific job I think coach coffin's in charge of the penalty kill and has done an outstanding job lately with that now in regards to to uh our power play um we had worked during the week with uh zaren uh on uh quarterbacking that power play and um all of a sudden he's out we were you know he was you know we're told now looking close to four weeks and so out of nowhere we put Travis white in that in that power play Spot I think it's up with two power play assist so uh it just shows you the less we work for the guys maybe the better off they are but you know all of a sudden there's two points and straight Travis stuff up in from a kid that a year ago couldn't even hardly see a shift and now all of a sudden he's out there in all situations I'm very proud of him and happy for him Coach can you go take you through the last two minutes of the first period just kind of some of your thoughts on that very you know you guys get two and then they add one with about 26 seconds yeah that's a good question one you all it's kind of blinked out of my mind I wasn't too upset with the they got it was great to it would have been nice go to the between perod for the two to and realistically our first goal um that cter scored was a big goal for us being down two nothing I thought we were a bit listless we were on our heels they definitely jumped us and to get that goal I thought really helped right the ship um but then their third goal was a fluky goal realistically uh with a shot it hit the boards and it it pered over the net to their player who picked it out of the air great play by him but very unfortunate bounce very unusual bounce to see it you know was almost ice level hits the backboard pops straight up over our goal right out in front uh now with that said you know that was one of you know one of the more innocent plays all night I thought they generated a lot of good scoring chances I really thought UF played very well I thought um if it had been for CJ the numbers uh instead of three goal SKS might have been closer to five and we know as coach and staff that we won't continue to win games giving up three goals a night that that's gonna just that's that's you can never count on your offense to to score that many every game and uh so we're going to need to to start paying attention to our defensive play um and like I said that number could have much higher tonight more than three goals for UF had our goal today not played so well did you feel there was a turning point in that second period you guys get three um where felt like moment was kind of in your favor at all uh not really I I I I didn't truthfully I didn't feel very comfortable until Cory K scored the six goal you know up to that point it's a two goal game it's five minutes to go I mean they bang went home now we're down to the last minute they pull a goalie we're looking at tie over time shoot out I've been there done that you know what I'm saying so no time I feel that tied ever shifted I I always felt like that game was up for grab until when Cory scored then so like okay well you know PR of the you mentioned Scot being out can you talk about the play of of players like Conor and some of the Freshman obviously Travis white stepping up in his abs yeah no I I can talk about that I thought uh Travis White's really played very well like I said he's been a blessing uh and maybe he had not been for zern going down uh Travis would have seen that in my I time he's really been shot in the arm for us we're very happy with the play of all our fres defenseman right now um but I think the biggest surprise hands down to me in terms of defenseman is that I play Travis white tripping okay thanks guys got her up buddy next we have Conor Schmid your number two star of the game who scored his first yeah playing simple counter kid just takes through that goal you saw um well came out of the bench and uh Puck squirted out and caught it and this time I had a little bit more time so I picked my head up and I know I don't have the hardest shot in the league so I tried to put it low and good screen and just found the back in that Conor you know with a lot of freshman defensive back there can you talk about the early season how you feel like you guys from beginning uh yeah like coming to college com to this level I mean like starts in the waight room like before working out you think you push yourself to limit until you came here and then you really know your limit and just preparing the preparation is a lot different and I mean our confidence level too coming to a league like this like I know my confidence is down I mean this go really help but I mean it's just we have a great group of freshman so I think we're playing well and then you the assist on the go by um yeah it was just a scamman neutral zone I stepped and saw ker break in and I just fed him and they do the rest yeah I was shoting out the you seem always out there to play with the main streak whether it's pushing or shoving after the whistle or finishing every hit is that an aspect of uh your game that you would say is a strong part uh yeah I mean I know being this height and this weight I mean I have to play like I'm 6'3 cuz I'm not 6'3 I mean that's a big part of my game but I mean I have to lay off on the penalties thank you next we have Captain Kylie bonus your number one star of the game who scored two goals tonight cap s c congratulations on the hot start four goals in five games if you could take us through uh those two goals night um well the first one was a great shot by P I kind of moving the par round really well in the power play and looking to capitalize after scored that big goal and he kind of just found the lane just banged off and he went in the second one again on the power play it wasn't our normal unit but um again was great popular guys were staying composed and trying to find lanes and an unbelievable pass it seemed like they went for a leg and a stick and every guy their found me and um I got it on the rebound after a goal made one save feels good to contribute for sure coming M you're working on power play First Time season can you talk about your you guys did tonight power play is kind of a funny thing it's it's uh really confidence-based it's something that you have to spend a lot of time almost being frustrated in practice because we do have such a good time of kill I think that really helps us we have we have guys that um that work so hard to make us better in practice every day and I think that helps us a lot in the game but it's against a team like Alaska too they uh they're really aggressive and they they play their CHS well so it's just quick Puck movement getting pucks on net and making it uncomfortable for the you feel like you know you guys felt behind nothing really the gold by Conor did that give you guys a little bit of confidence going forward yeah absolutely I think um I think we came out a little stag I thought they really took it to us for probably the first 15 minutes of that per the first period um and then was making a great play that he's a guy that like you guys said talk he plays so hard and he he really puts his heart and slow into it so especially an offensive uh contribution from a guy like that is really uplifting",

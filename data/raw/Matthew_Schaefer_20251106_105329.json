The 17-year-old defenseman talked about the moment he heard his name called. âIt was awesome. It was amazing,â Schaefer said on the show. âLots of tears that day. Definitely got the best of me. To hear your name called is a dream come true and itâs every kidâs dream to get into the NHL. Itâs such an honor to be drafted by such a great organization.â Schaefer lost his mom, Jennifer, to breast cancer in February of 2024, and kept her close to his heart during the draft. He arrived at the draft in a suit with photos of his mother sewn on the inside, then, when he received his draft day jersey from the Islanders, the team had pinned a pink breast cancer ribbon on the sweater, along with his momâs initials. He showed the jersey to the hosts on the show. âIt means a lot,â he said. âItâs an honor when I get drafted by such a great team, but then they do that, it goes a long way.â It was an emotional moment for the teenager and his father, Todd, on one of the biggest stages. On the show, Schaefer discussed his dadâs role in his life. âHeâs always there for me and my brother, obviously though the tough times,â Schaefer said. âSo, to have him in my corner, and my brother, it helps a lot.â Schaefer also discussed his brief time on Long Island so far and expressed his excitement to join the team. After making a full recovery from his injury this season, Schaefer made it clear that he is more than ready to hit the ground â or ice â running. âIâve been through a lot in life, and that makes me stronger,â he said. âInjuries are really easy compared to a lot of other things. Itâs just a bump in the road. Just have to work as hard as you can to get back at it.â",

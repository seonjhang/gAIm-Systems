Kyle Bonis	[Music] H Sheldon in Harrison wat for FSU torch.com we're at David live Ice Arena here to preview Fair State's last regular season ccha series scheduled for March 1st and 2nd at the University of Michigan do you think of today's practice I mean getting ready for this huge Series against Michigan could you love me through what you thought of today's perform it's a pretty standard practice it was a good Tempo and uh granted we had a week off but just just pretty standard practice that week off really helped get you ready for this upcoming series when you had some injuries and also some illnesses to work through I think it's a good thing considering uh we did have a lot of injuries we still have a lot of guys still nursing some injuries and um granted it's really late in the season as well I think a week off help physically mentally maybe not so much cuz you kind to get out of that Rhythm but uh you know hopefully we use it for uh as a positive how imperative is this upcoming Series against Michigan for you in the ccha standings as this is the last series in the CC Chas uh well it means a lot uh it's we want to get home ICE obviously and uh if we win both games I'm pretty sure I think we lock it up and it's uh we like playing at home I think our our style of play is really geared to towards our home Rank and uh I think we definitely feel more comfortable at home and when you play Michigan it's they're a really good team you always want to bring your year after a lot of these people they've grown up uh Michigan kids they want to play for that team and when you play them it's it's uh it's just different it's a different type of game with this series being your last in the ccha regular season tell me what you are most proud of achieving at Fair State you know I I would say probably last year went the went in the CC season title uh I think that was just such a team accomplishment that we were're able to do and especially because you know this program's come such a long way in developing and becoming a a for contender so I think those are a lot of things definitely last year with the winning the CCH that was a really great experience and one I'll remember last year you're also ranked first in the nation for the first time in's history you just tell me more about you know how last year's performance kind of carried over for you and then to amp up the team well you know I I think I think personally gave gave everyone that was there last year confidence that you know we were we were like kind a force and a team to beat in not only the season but all college hockey I think when you when you get that sort of confidence it it kind of lingers that's a good thing so I think you know if you get in situations where it's tough you're down in a game whatever you can draw on past experiences and know that you have the ability to win games so you know I think that's kind of what I've tried to use and just try to lead by example knowing that you know what this team's capable of in the past you've talked to me about how that confidence also pours over into special teams um tell me what you'd like about your special teams against Michigan this season who doesn't necessarily have the best penalty kill in the ccha uh you know I think we've had a very good power play for uh for a lot of the year um I think the one thing that is kind of an unknown about migan is their power play now because the when we played the first time John Merl was hurt and he's obviously a big part of their power play so they uh they've made some adjustments you know they've moved turbo over so he can hit the onetime and he's got a big time shot so those are some things we have to work on the PK but you know if we you know with our power play we stick to our system and how we want to run things and you know hopefully we're going be successful who do you expect on your defensive line to uh really help curve Michigan's offensive ability high-scoring team well it's going to be great to have joh back you know it looks like he's going to come back in the play or come back in the lineup so you know we've uh you know I I would say that the other guys that play have played very well but it's definitely going to be nice to have him back there he's so so poised and steady and he keeps everyone you know uh kind of in sync back there at the PK so it's going to be nice to have him back in the mix I think he'll be a huge addition for us you know any uh do you know anything about Travis's current condition uh he's scared the last two days as far as I know he's been feeling good so you know we'll just go from there um Scott could you just tell me you're returning to the Bulldogs lineup this weekend against Michigan in the last ccha series You'll Play in a regular season um you've been injured for most of this season and how important is this series to you now that you're coming back oh it's very important I mean I'm the line we own we have our own destiny in our hand for homeless Advantage me getting back and do it is just to help me for playoffs um I'm going to put my best effort in hopefully help the team get out for the win we need both wins this weekend and we get home Advantage for the playoffs where do you want to be playing the most when you're on special teams uh from Special Teams I PK just get the Pu BL shots hard play I do what I can do break Puck out puck in that with the disbandment of the ccha looming can you just tell me what you see the future of this program doing in the WCC wcaa uh I feel like we could definitely be a Power House in that League we are in this league um there's not much to tell we haven't played much of those teams W cha uhan it's going be Olympic sheet most of the games which we haven't played much but I mean sure we can get used to it it's not that hard to adapt to it I mean I feel like we should be a Powerhouse I mean we don't know though any team we haveen played how excited are you to be a senior blue liner next year very excited very excited to get back hopefully uh stay healthy next season uh definitely want to have a good run rest of your year again just like hopefully get a good run this year like last year so here with CJ M hold starting golender uh CJ can you talk about um your ability to play the CL and how it helps both the offense and the defense I I think I think uh really faster we can get it in our hands the better so try to get out there and stop it that way we can get in our defensive hands uh that way we get as quick as possible and then also if they dump down on me I think it's uh kind of in the back of their team's mind maybe I can shot a stretch guy and they're changing um you played the most minut in CCA I think you're third in the country right now in minutes um can you talk about uh how you've been able to work um work weekend in weekend out uh without having any injury problems or anything and just being really consistently in the that for these guys I think start I'll started this summer uh I was here summer working out with uh the guys who stayed here in our Dave sensor drink conditioning coach I think he really got me uh in shape ready to play the minutes he thought that I might be able to play this season and then uh just uh you know getting my rest getting the right kind of stuff in me to make sure that I'm still ready to go out tip top shape every night um talked about Michigan pretty good offensive team here coming up uh how do you do you watch film for this or do you just prepare on the ice mostly for a team like Michigan and their offensive punch oh yeah we do a little video on them uh against their last weekend opponent but uh then again it's got to worry about us more than them you know it's got to get on the ice and PR what we do best and get hard work in and that way uh we can do what we need to do on the ice important week of practice coming up uh what do you uh what's the big Focus this week going into a big Series against Michigan um basically I think we just got to get playoff ready I think that uh this practice you know this week's got to be a lot of high-intensity stuff and um basically focus on you know getting our lights moving and getting ready for uh the upcoming series after that I mean you know you don't want to look ahead too much but obviously uh this this series also has a lot of stake um home the Home Advantage home ICE Advantage for playoffs so I think if we bring the playoff mentality into this series um you know whoever playing doesn't really matter I mean just focus on that as much as we can so that we'll be ready for the following one um as well and you know just play a good hobby how how important has the continuity of the Season been on the top lines you know for the most part you've had same top lines apart from a let being injured but how unimportant is that you talk about that for me um you know I think that's huge obviously uh you want to have guys that you know mess well together and when you have you know a line that's that's doing so and and putting out points and helping the team I think that's big uh obviously olette bonus are great players and definitely shows on the score sheet and you know in practice and everywhere um you know that definitely a big thing to have with Team here with Coach Daniels head coach the fair State hockey team uh first of all can you talk about um CJ's ability to play the puck and how it um you know I I don't think it's been talked about enough because especially in the western game you saw a lot of instances we played it really successfully well that's a great point you bring up and you know what we haven't explored all the Avenues we can use ability his he can really play the puck well and so can Charles Williams and I see it every day in practice and just as of late we've been trying to explore different ways to incorporate their ability to move the puck into our game plan and you know if you look at our our rink here uh the one odity we have is the way the boards uh our Corners are it funnels a lot of pucks behind the net so if we can find a way to incorporate our go tenders into helping us break the puck out I think it's going to Bod well for the future so uh we're trying and and I think we can open it up a little bit more as time goes on obviously big elephant in the room here is home I advantage in the first round of the playoffs and U Ohio State's already done their part by losing two games and a sweep guarantees home ICE how imperative is it to get it um especially for your guys being as beat up as they have been this season wow it's real imperative but you know what I I like is the fact that uh we set our goals like like steps and our first goal was to finish and get a Buy in the first so we a mission accomplish there our second goal get home I so that's right out in front of us third goal go to the Joe fourth goal win a championship so we've got the goals set out ahead of us we have the ability to continue to attain all these goals and while we feel comfortable if we were to go on the road I think we could win on the road uh in the playoffs it would be much easier to do it in front of our home fans and our students than it would be if we have to go on the road um most of the team has given me you know the whole while we're not looking forward to so I'll you know go one at a time here what's your focus for friday night's game especially well this Friday night like obviously winning because it's the focus but how do you get to that I think one of the keys defensively for us is going to be making sure we have a third man back I Michigan is so good at scoring on line rushes that we always want to make sure we have a third player back that that we're not giving them odd man rushes at our net the second thing is there's going to be turnovers but we want to make sure we know where that Puck's going to be when we turn it over you know if it for instance if we can't penetrate in the zone we're going to have to be willing to dump the puck in because if we turn it over in bad areas for instance in golf if you if you miss a hole or you miss the green a lot of your golfers out there will know then you want to miss it on the right side where you've got some room to still work with well the same thing here is if we turn the puck over when we do it we want to do it in such a way as we can get back defensively how important would a gritty game against Michigan be when it's going to be a war you know I think we're well prepared for it I it's going to be very difficult series and and it's going to be a battle but my God I look back the series against Western was was really a battle a Notre Dame Bowling Green I mean every series in the second half and more than I ever remember in the past it it seems to me like we've been in almost playoff mode since we played Michigan State to start the second half of the year and the reason I say it is in our League playoff positioning counts for so much fifth place gets you a buy fourth place gets you home ice so there's a lot riding on each position in the standings and I felt like this year as much as last you're going for the regular season title I felt like this year we've been on our game or having to be really on our game each and every weekend [Music] [Applause]
	i chose michigan because it covers everything culture and academics and obviously the facilities here you see are perfect and and you know the coaches were really great to me so i thought it was just a perfect fit i started playing hockey i guess when i think four years old just yeah i grew up playing in bc there and in bantam our team had a little tournament at penn state and that was kind of some big exposure for me for how cool the big ten is and i just thought like wow this is a this is an awesome conference it'd be really cool to play in and then yeah it was a definitely kind of helped me expose me to the college row i'm a highly skilled offensive player who uh made creative plays and uh help create scoring chances with the puck in the net power nearly shoveled it in past brady and then on the rebound it comes back out to kent johnson who pokes at home and it's another fast start for michigan i just love hockey because it's so fun to to make plays and win and uh scoring goals and i just think there's a such a fast-paced game and so much room for skill and i just love that
	players here's dylan gunther he'll chip it up the right side as he's closed off by edmondson sure bob mckenzie's watching he'll probably make the call who he moves as they're both tied for second on bob's list i was joking with bobby and that was the year that tyson jose wrote conor mcdavid's points record in a tournament for a canadian player with 15 points mcdavid as an underager had 14 when they last won gold in 2013 in russia battle behind millage minute 45 remaining in this first period as the official saying move uhl is his preparation video stretching before after he says this young man trains like an nhl player right as sweden was going off for a change everyone up everyone okay edmondson trying to take it away from stillman here comes edmondson steele edvinson wrist shot blocked in front by zenetti [Music] puck chipped but not out here's edmondson again again the puck blocked this time by sidler robertson sidler behind the net simon robertson centering pass comes to edmondson nice pass to the middle shot goes just wide off the stick of robin off the draw cross ice pass to lasalle through the middle wrist shot nicole edvinson checked keeps the puck across to door nelson triangle pass to the middle deflects in for a goal edmundson nice steal right at the blue line sweden coming in numbers they'll send it across here's some shoots edmonson tries to follow the zone for latvia schultz he gets taken down right in front of the kind of the things they have to do goldberg sunday in that shot and getting in the way just thomas montan who is here the head coach of the world junior that's closing get in there quickly close the play simon edmonds able to handle the bouncing pot up for edmondson screwdriver goes right to the net nice move edmondson stick paneling lost the puck backed up simon edson bringing it in deep still with the and i better not hear one canadian player say oh we took them lightly edmondson still on it good puck possession in quickly he'll circle a lot hits evans divine trying to takes track big body check edmondson laid into him pops to center ice sweden controls edmondson takes the pass in stride some space edmondson cutting in he'll go behind the net still on the puck he'll drop it off for lucelle lucelle stick handling back for edmondson he'll poke it along chips it in edmondson using his skating good little moves in his own zone to get away from the pressure looking for lucelle the home run pass take atm it's an atm backdoor pass and vincent had the wide open net in the big defenseman couldn't force russia back in 2019 as we wait our first goal in this game hoffman trying to get the puck can not sweden controls one of the star players for sweden here's gunther trying to drive in again it's edmonson cutting him off in tight they're going to have to make that adjustment but sweden is really playing sharp trying to face the royal what a play by edmondson program they have been a force in this tournament not to be this year on home isis edmondson collects the puck tries to walk in and will edmondson cutting in tries to tuck it home still on the puck takes it behind the net flips it in front olson edmondson he's going to switch up spots go down though rosen what zamber scores advantage of a five on three a little kickback and then johnston nice little chip and chase one-handed going after the buck 35 minutes gone in this third period what a play by edmondson flutters one in and that didn't miss by much traveling from the blue line trying to connect edmondson centering past zellweger there and another guy like that logan stan colvin wears number 11 much like another guy in the nhl that does the same double their lead second period aku makes the initial save and it's cleared off the line but simon evanson sticking with it and it's in there
	with how long this season has felt it's easy to forget how dynamic freshman maddie beneath ended up with the wolverines originally he was full goal with harvard i never figured out i want to go to harvard it was close to home that was always something that was important to me but then covet happened and they canceled their season pretty much and i kind of had to make a decision whether i wanted to go to ushl or looking at their schools fortunately he looked at michigan i just kind of really liked it the first time i kind of looked around and kind of felt like the right place and you know when you get that feeling and that's kind of the feeling i got so i think like two weeks before school started i ended up applying here and getting in so that's kind of how i got here it was all it was all pretty crazy summer to say the least a crazy summer followed by an even crazier season but veneers excel leading the wolverines in shot percentage and goals during the regular season lighting the lamp 10 times i didn't really put too much pressure on myself to do really well i didn't really think about like obviously it's my draft season i don't really think about that too much it's just kind of like going out there and having fun that's kind of something that's my dad's always taught me when i was growing up and then now here i can try to like keep keep that going maddie talks about love of the game over expectations and that approach has helped elevate his team as well he's been a tremendous all-around player you trust him as a coach to play in any situation you know he's going to play on the right side of the puck and then he's got the skill offensively to play on the offensive side so very fortunate to have him here and he's a lot of fun to coach in practice he makes everyone a better player just you're going up against him and you kind of like okay i'm going up against maddie i have to i have to be ready but i feel bad for other guys in the big ten who have to play against him and i think he's got everything he's got the heart he's got the attitude he's got the work ethic ironically despite his marksmanship this year benier says he's always been a past first kind of player i kind of just like really focused in the last like couple months here working with coaches on like shooting getting a better shot like my release and even just being like like knowing when to shoot and when to pass let me get this straight the team's leading goal scorer needs work on his goal scoring mentality yeah i know i know i think hopefully if i keep doing that you know results will show but it's it's always nice when you are working really hard at something and then you get a little success in that area so hopefully i can keep that going along with everyone else who supports the maze in blue for m gold blue tv i'm ed kingurski
	hi I'm Mason McTavish I play for the Pembroke lumber Kings u18 and I'm from Karp Ontario Mason McTavish is one of the most gifted offensive players in this in this year's draft he's a he's a big kid protects the puck real well and probably his biggest attribute is his shot I haven't seen a 15 year old shoot a puck like Mason does it's on a stick it's off his stick he's got a quick release and great velocity and pinpoint accuracy Mason's a 200-foot player at center he's very good in his own end and when he gets that puck coming through the neutral zone he's bullish he drives hard and he's a big player and he's hard to contain when he gets his feet moving and he wants the puck on his stick he is the go-to guy and he wants to score goals or set up plays I'd say I'm a playmaker and I like to shoot the puck obviously I play with really good line mates so it makes it a lot easier to do what I can do I like to model my game after Austin Matthews we're both pretty big for H well my age I guess and yeah we both I think we play the same way and I look up to what would you say is the strongest part of your game right now I'd say the way I can see the play develop and know where my teammates are and knowing when they when they want the puck and where they want it offensively speaking he's a game breaker he can turn the game over free in your favor almost every time was on the ice he was voted the MVP in the top prospect of ryu 18 league in the hto recently won a championship with his team at Pembroke lumber kings and they're deciding Game three of the finals he scored five goals they won five to one he scored the power play scored short handed scored even strength so he's an exceptional athlete with a very high ceiling offensively everybody's got to get a little bit stronger a little bit faster before they can take that next step with a couple other things that you'll be working on this offseason I'll be in the gym every day and I work with Pat Malloy in the summer he's a great skating coach and yeah that's about it who's had the most influence on your career I definitely my mom my brother my might they're both they're all like they'll really help me out through the through my career and hopefully they keep doing that oh what's been your favorite hockey moment I think it's definitely gonna be this once it's all over it's gonna be I think it's gonna be really fun and I'll remember it over the years he's a natural goal scorer with a heavy shot and it's accurate and it's hard and it gets to the net fast and he can put the puck in the net many different ways and around the net short-handed and like I said with that heavy shot if you could pick to dream line mates to play on a line with who would be on a line with you definitely Wayne Gretzky and Mariela mio they're both best players in though in the world so yeah those do yeah I think it I think it all depends on where he goes you know a lot of you know a lot of the OHL is about opportunity as a 16 year old so you know if he gets given the opportunity to play he is in the right spot in the right situations I think he's got the skill set to produce for sure and physically you know he's ready to play in the league this year you know he is a big thick young man I think Mason with his physical maturation with his offensive abilities in his shot I think he can step in and shoulder right away and have an impact you can play anywhere in the lineup he can do a number of jobs I assume as being an impact player immediately next year and what will mean for you when you hear your name called on draft morning it's gonna be very exciting not too sure I'm gonna be in or well on I'll end up but I'm sure it's gonna be a really fun so anywhere
	I'm Jack used Quinn's brother I'm Luke use Quinn's brother what can you tell us about your brother unbelievable talent like so exciting the fans will love them just just a player that'll take you out of your seat kind of as a fan like so uh such a good skater so smart so skilled so but even the better part I mean he's such a great person I mean it'll be really good with the fans he'll be really good with the community and stop and talk to kids so he's a really good person did you guys teach him everything he knows yeah older brother I mean he is a huge influence on both of us any good stories about him growing up there's a lot actually you know there's a lot of funny stories some some fights and that stuff but uh I don't not really any off my head right now but there's so many probably an appropriate I can't say our camera to I mean House of three boys all really competitive and definitely fights breaking out injury stuff like that so we had it we're really good childhood growing up it's quite the hockey household you guys have yeah it's really cool I mean our parents both played at a high levels my father of course worked in a hockey for a while and he still does I mean that's all we do talk about hockey watch hockey play hockey so what was the moment like when you heard Quinn's name I was just so proud of him and I was excited and just a bunch of mix of emotion so I was I was just proud of him and yeah I love him so much so yeah yeah for me I so excited like I felt like I got drafted kind of I was like jumping up and down yes I mean I know it's a spot he really really wanted to go to hockey market Canadian City so I'm really excited for him and I'm just super proud of him you're personally pretty excited for the draft in Vancouver next year why yeah for sure I mean especially with Quinn going there should be really cool and then a lot of a lot of events in Vancouver this coming year so it should be exciting but I mean there's nothing I can do really just play my game what just thought of playing against your brother in the NHL someday I'd be cool I my preference would be play with them she's so good but I mean just to be able to for both of us the three of us to have the chance to play in the NHL that would just be unbelievable stuff
Kyle Bonis	Claire Dao is standing by just outside the locker of the man who ended up being the number one star tonight Kyle bonus yeah Kyle bonesaw bonus this weekend now Kyle quite a game for you it's always tough three and three the fact that you guys were able to pull this one out what does it say about this team I mean it says a lot we showed a ton of character especially you know starting starting on the road you know 7:30 late-game with a little bit of travel and that's the tough tough thing to do and it's a mental challenge and it's a physical challenge as well but you know we were ready for it we had a great week of practice and you know we were rewarded for with six points but I mean that's a really good hockey team so we're happy with the result yeah that 2 goal lead in the second but then just before that second intermission they scored it to make it a one goal game what was the mindset in that second intermission stepping on guys for the third I mean we knew we were in a good spot you know we like to be obviously having a lead going the third period in this building is huge and you know they do a really good job of when you know we got momentum this weekend they seemed like both teams actually was kind of back and forth and no one really was able to hold momentum for a long long span of time so when we started the third period well created some offense and got some chances and then you know had some gun will go in that was great you were a busy guy tonight obviously a goal couple of assists some great puck movement on that first assist you had yeah you know that's we work a lot on our line rushes and you know sometimes I think you can almost get too complicated with things but you know middle lane Drive and wide and you know cloudy you just came down and he seems like a really really good offensive mind and we try to get in the puck in those scoring areas and he'll put it away you had a pretty goal as well they're just kind of firing it right past how good did it feel it felt really good um you know obviously it's always nice to contribute we have such a deep offensive team that it seems like it can be it can be any any one of nine or ten forest arrests and you know tonight it was my turn but you know I knew with Winnie when he had the puck up in the wing reel off from all the second intermission I think I had my stick ready I thought the red line cuz I knew he was passing it so it was good to have that one going alright well thank you so much Congrats on the win best of luck in case you will see you saturday perfect thanks

of questions about hockey obviously so uh what made you guys get into hockey in the first place and did you guys play any other sports growing up a lot ago um so my whole my both my brothers played hockey growing up um my dad grandpa played hockey um so it's kind of just like all all in the family and um started at a young age um so yeah i kind of just grew up into that and fell in love with it that way um and then growing up i think it was just hockey um i played track and field maybe like i ran track and field like one one or two years um that was it though but pretty much just hockey um just focusing on that yeah um my brother well my dad played hockey growing growing up and uh my brother was always playing hockey and when i was young i just like watched my brother and i would grab a stick when i was like barely walking just playing around in the driveway um but i played i played a lot of sports going up i played soccer i played well i played soccer really young but i mean they played like baseball across in hockey so i was kind of all over the place all the time i was i just had a ton of energy as a kid so i was running around doing everything and then uh i was always probably the best at hockey and i loved it the most out of the three so i kind of just every year i would narrow it down and i played baseball until i i stopped playing baseball when i went to the ntdp so i mean i still love all sports but like hockey's definitely the one right now yeah you definitely made the right choice yeah um do you guys have any nicknames and uh what's your favorite jersey number and why um my nickname they just call me truss um that's pretty much stuck with me um throughout my hockey career and then my favorite jersey number would be 20 all my family wore it both my brothers my dad my grandpa all are 20 throughout their career so that's definitely a number that's that's one of my favorites so uh anytime i get a chance to wear that i will yeah 20 is my favorite number two all right it'd be nice to see you wearing that and uh the canucks blue bro yeah yeah hopefully actually the the jersey this year uh since we got drafted in 2020 oh yeah on the back so i was pretty excited about that well i look better than centers that's for sure hey on that note mike thought he mike's favorite number might be 20 but he wears 89 and all it all sports too his mother got 20. ah i see and um maddie um yeah they call me maddie i mean some guys call me benny or bernie um i don't know they i don't really care whatever whatever works but usually just maddie and uh i've been number 10 like my whole life i think my dad was number 10 so i kind of just picked that up and it's always been like it's always been my number so it's always been my favorite i gotta give you credit on that uh stash too man pretty pretty good pretty good stash for uh only being november what nine today some of that i don't know i've been i've been tempted to shave but i'm staying strong it's getting a little long but yeah like i'm i'm 37 and i can't even grow a mustache there look i got two handlebars there's been like 10 guys asking me like oh how much only men or only men whatever did you put in that i was like nothing i used to do that i'm not going to lie i used to always buy the just for men and just make it real dark oh yeah everyone on our team i never knew that fact about big mike they're like you're never gonna think you're getting sure the rest of our life like come on man oh yeah hey who's your guy's favorite sports hero ryan fix your mic who's your guys's favorite sports hero favorite sports hero i mean i gotta go tom brady obviously nice good choice a winner yeah growing up i mean i didn't really live in a tough time where the patriots were bad i know my dad's always like you guys are blessed but like i grew up where i mean we were getting super bowls left and right so tom brady obviously just like the way uh not only because he's a winner but just like his whole story it's just like the whole underdog story comes out on top pretty amazing okay one yeah one funny story i obviously was when russell wilson handed the should i handed the ball off instead of throwing it that's my favorite brady story i know i was sitting i was i was at like i don't even know i was at like a sixth grade or seventh grade birthday party that day and we were just sitting downstairs we're like it's over like the whole grade was there we sit in the basement they throw the ball in the one yard line with the best running back like marshawn lynch was just eating up the patriots that whole game and we got a pick and it was just like insane one of one of the worst days of my life besides perhaps 2011 2011 stanley cup finals yeah it was good it was a good day it was definitely a good day um um i guess i just have to go with like nick lynch room i i grew up watching him a lot um he was kind of my idol on defense back there growing up uh he brought a lot of cups to detroit so i definitely looked up to that and uh he was a big hero in detroit for a while so um you know one of the best defensemans there is so it was nice looking up to him yeah definitely if you can be a half is that we could uh we'd love that yeah um i might as well go to the next question which was that i was giving my next question was who do you guys try and play like or emulate your game like um i don't know i always get this question i'm always like in between a bunch of players because i never really know i mean i always go about like i always go with the boston guys i think uh i think bergeron and i always go in between bergeron and crazy because i think i play a two-way game like bergeron and i grew up watching him he just like kind of plays in every position every situation i think i kind of play like that and then also like create you the way he thinks the game the way he passes moves the puck makes guys about him better that's kind of my two um i'd say zack rowanski um i kind of just like grew up watching him play detroit um growing up uh went to the program and then went to michigan so i i've had a chance to watch him a lot so um he's definitely someone i try to play like um just like his two-way game uh he's really good at jumping in the rush creating plays so that's definitely someone i i try to watch a lot on video and try to catch any of the games i can [Music] yeah what do you guys think the biggest transitions for both of you will be uh going to michigan this year um so last year we got a little um we got to play college games uh we're pretty fortunate enough to do that and kind of get used to the the speed and the style of that and uh the physical play so i think just still being able to adjust to that um even though we're a little more comfortable getting those those schemes and uh i mean probably like 10 games in on the college series so um yeah it's just still just adjusting that speed and uh physical play will definitely be a huge change from the ushl and uh international play yeah a lot of what he said i think pace um paige is gonna be a little different i think we got a little taste of that but not really uh that close to what it's gonna be like because obviously when you're playing in ntdp like those college guys don't really want to be there they're like oh i'm in mid-season i have to play this high school team right now but um like it's gonna be a little different when michigan playing michigan state so i think it's just like getting ready for that pace and that like um and that like rivalry that we've kind of missed uh like obviously like when you're playing high school hockey you have your rival like that game's always so big a lot of intensity like a lot of like nerves are running so kind of just getting back to that with like a lot of teams like when you're playing ohio state a lot of bigger guys like gonna be hitting you all over the ice it's gonna be taxing but so i think a little bit of that okay maddie what to change your decision to go to michigan after decommitting from harvard um other than obviously the amazing hockey team loaded with nhl town hockey history and is was it because of the obviously them not going back because of covid oh yeah that was that was pretty much the main reason that i switched at all um i was committed to going to harvard 100 uh i originally wanted to be close to home that was always something i wanted to do uh be close like growing up i was like oh i want to play in front of my family like in boston that was always like a big thing and obviously like i mean i know a lot of boston guys not a lot of boston guys leave boston to play hockey um but when code happened uh harvard decided they weren't gonna play until january and i just thought like it would be the best idea for me to look around and i told the coaches that so in michigan i actually never looked in michigan in my life i was like no way i'm leaving no way and uh when this all happened i just was um i just kind of looked at michigan and just kind of had everything all the pieces for me that i wanted and i kind of made a little bit of a hockey choice uh i think before i was making a little bit more like a life choice when i was picking harvard but i think this is also a great academic school and that's also very important for me so absolutely kind of has the best of both worlds and um and also coach mayott uh our assistant coach here uh that's one of the probably one of the biggest reasons that this all came together is because he recruited me since i mean maybe like eight or ninth grade i knew him we had a really good relationship with my family just come to the ranks always watching me and so um and obviously he moved here so him being here was is a big reason why i'm here now well i definitely think you made the right decision i mean that team's loaded you guys are stuck this year and uh we can't wait to see how far you guys go you guys have a favorite road barn um there's gonna be that one rank when you guys all even if it was a couple years ago or whatever you guys go to and you just you love playing there because the fans are all intense or whatever i think cornell was yeah that was sick um like that was a really cool building yeah like the fans are crazy there and it was like an old barn so it was kind of kind of unique and um yeah i thought it was pretty cool yeah you know it sucked to play there but yeah i've um both my parents and my sister went there so i've been there a lot like in the stands and it's always like one of my it was like one of my favorite places to watch a game and then being on the ice it was insane so uh they like they love to get into it down there and it's just like it's an old barn you just kind of it's gritty the way they play they're just knocking you on your butt the whole night so it's it's fun to play there for sure right on yeah it's always good when the fans get into it take me back to you guys's first goals at the us national u18 team and do you guys still love the [ __ ] oh i think mine was against the null team it was like our first weekend i was like playing well i was a little upset i was like i haven't gone i haven't gotten a goal yet i can't get one in and i think it was on the it was on the pk i somehow managed to grab a breakaway and i slid one five hole and yeah it was a it was a great feeling finally get on the puck um i don't think so i don't think i have it you don't keep that i don't i don't i know i wish i had it i don't know i don't even i don't think anyone grabbed it we didn't really do that at the pro at uh the program we didn't really grab boxer since we're all like we're all the same yeah so usually it's the older guys in the park for the young freshman but we didn't really do that um my first school uh was at home in plymouth and um i was actually playing one of my buddies from back home that i skated with all summer and uh i've known him for a while um i'm pretty sure he was on the ice so it's pretty cool to score that goal and um how'd you score yeah i kind of like shipped the puck to the middle um and kind of just like it was kind of the puck was wobbling and i i shot it and it was kind of just like a wobbly puck but i fooled the goalie a little bit so a goal is a goal a goal yeah exactly hey i got tons of garbage goals and beer league hockey i'm the best player on the team of course but yeah they all come so yeah yeah you guys have both represented your countries and worn the red white and blue uh what's the feeling of tossing that jersey on yeah it's a it's a stressful feeling i mean um you don't really know until until it's gone how much you miss it uh we kind of got it snatched away with covid i'm sure a lot of guys have went through this feeling a lot of seniors at all the colleges that uh won't be able to put it on again um but it's just like a special feeling representing your country and knowing what it what it means to all the people watching so it was it's obviously a cool feeling you just got to like embrace every time you get to do it yeah i mean same as maddie like you know it's just an honor to put that on every day and um you know it gives you a sense of pride um yeah i mean it's an honor and um you definitely look forward to wearing any chance you can and uh you can't take it for granted um because you know we got a snatched away from us and now that you look back at it you you really are fortunate enough to be able to play for that team so uh yeah it was just a great experience maddie i gotta congratulate you too um if my stats are right here you also got a name to the world junior camp for the u.s hopefully i don't i don't know oh the camp yeah yeah the cat um yeah camp was camp was a lot of fun we had a couple of guys actually here that came came with me boards and brasson uh beach in new york so it was fun it was a little like it was good to finally get back on the ice that was probably my first game and what is it six months yeah a while so how'd you do i think it did well it was um obviously you're playing with a lot of good players but i think i i think i had a good showing so hopefully i can make that make the world junior team hey what's your guys's favorite movie about sports oh um miracle all the way all right the americans always got time i mean that's just my favorite movie all around so uh yeah i just have to say that yeah i mean miracle miracles up there um i mean i have to go with remember the titans it's just it's my all time it's probably my all-time favorite movie and it just happens that's a sports movie so that's yeah i love that movie oh we hear it all the time oh yeah yeah those those two are probably our most favorite answer from everybody pretty much what do you think about the movie greater the song have you seen that no no the last one i just watched was the new borah you gotta you gotta go watch uh you gotta go watch greater it's about this guy uh burlesworth and okay he played football and he wasn't that good he walked on in arkansas and he ended up being an all american like he didn't play at all his first year ends up being an all-american his senior year gets drafted by the colts and then passes away when he's 22. oh wow i'm gonna have to check that out yeah we've never even seen that you should write that down i will get that going tonight hey if you guys if you guys were an animal what would you be draft question yeah i actually did get that actually yeah i you know i when i was asked that i said line but i mean that's our most popular answer just because like the like i try to like lead by example and try to be respected by others so i i mean i guess that's that was kind of my answer for that the draft question um yeah i'd probably be a cheetah but there's like no symbolic to it i just love a boss they aren't when they fly so i'd definitely be a cheetah what was the weirdest one you guys ever got sorry mike that was your question uh from like a draft interview yeah um i've gotten asked like if you go to ikea um you buy a furniture set you bring it home in a box uh you're reading the directions or you putting it together by yourself there wasn't really a right answer there because i said uh you know i'd follow the directions and um kind of just follow the plan and i said oh so you're not confident and i was like well no like that's not true and then there's like a follow-up question um even i stay away from that place man ikea i don't want to put that [ __ ] together oh my god you know it was a connect thing it was a canucks thing because they have so many swedes that's cute i mean bordeaux doesn't want to put a bed together yeah we we all had to do some ikea stuff because we're living on a house right now and we're put together we've had borderline before actually oh we have had borderline bring him in he there was like 10 seconds and then yeah i sat on his bed like i may have like leaped on there but like obviously it should stay up just went right in what do you mean you didn't put it together right hey congrats on getting drafted too thank you thank you very much yeah i think i don't know i don't know i don't know if you saw our draft little video we took the clip of you getting drafted and i put your drop in where you gave us and it made a draft video oh no i didn't see it oh okay i'll have to try to send it over to your way nice yeah maddie what was it like uh getting called up and playing alongside jack hughes uh it was a lot of fun it was uh obviously those guys are all unreal players jack and turks coal uh bolts i mean they were they um they're really good to me uh they kind of took me in jack took me in like a little brother almost like kind of like show me his way i was just we roomed together so uh he was he was really good to me while i was up there made me feel comfortable same with all the guys so i'm really thankful for that and then obviously playing with them it was just like a good learning experience learning how they how they prepare for games how they play like kind of like picking things here and there off uh off their games like i love to watch uh zegras and his little moves uh so just like things here and there that you kind of pick up and it's obviously it was obviously really fun playing with them and then jax in the nhl the next year which is just crazy to see like one of your friends is right there so it was a lot of fun yeah we met all those guys at the draft out here in vancouver and uh they're all beauties off the ice as well i mean caufield and zegras and baldi and turcotte and hughes and all those good american kids uh they're all they're all beauties off the ice as well yeah definitely yeah we we tried to go get a hot dog before the draft and all the guys who caught them coming out of the elevator or something yeah yeah they're good guys hey what do you think makes a good captain um i um i feel like it's different for everyone for me i like uh i like someone who i look up to uh and like their habits and just like how they carry themselves whether they're a really good player or really like or they're fourth line or they don't play at all like for me it doesn't really matter with that uh um i really like someone that i look up to as a person and then i feel like everything else just kind of comes and leading for other people yeah i'd say the same thing like um someone that leads by example um someone that i respect um you know they're not afraid to like call people out and you know hold people accountable um i think we have a great set of captains here and not only the captains but like everyone on the team um they're great leaders so um yeah i just i respect everyone and um but yeah someone that can lead by example and everything like that so do you guys have any pregame meals or rituals um we were talking about this we're gonna get some going i don't really know we were actually just talking about those really good we're gonna get something for the games um meals i usually go uh steak broccolini and rice or chicken cutlets rice and some some kind of asparagus usually something like that and then rituals um like last year was pretty much like i got i had like handshakes with um a couple of the guys before the games and i uh i'm like one of the guys i love i like to stick handle and shoot box right before the game just get the hands moving other than that nothing too crazy i'm not too superstitious um for me pregame meal probably like tortellini and chicken and then like a salad or something and then pregame rituals um i they're gonna laugh but i meditate before i came so like that kind of gets me going and then other than that i think everything else is just kind of like a routine yeah routine uh like same stretches same same everything is there a song that you guys might play you guys always have a go-to song for or what would i find in your playlist uh couple i mean i'm definitely throwing some eminem in there um he's the goat i love them um i got probably dreams and nightmares we would go dreams and nightmares and then this song called the little things by big gigantic and that was uh that was right before we walked when there was like a speech and i don't know it's been a while since we've played so i might have to update all of you okay how about what songs you play in the gym to get you amped uh our gym was crazy we would throw wait well we would go from we do big booty mix if you ever heard of that yeah i like the sounds of it though that sounds really awesome you just pop that on and let it play off or something yeah like i mean our gym at mtv was crazy i mean we would get like we had a couple guys that would like rotate through the music it was like maybe like landon slagger faber i would jump in there every once in a while but we would be from like rap to country to like 80s music like we'd throw on like a mountain high in there like a lot of crazy songs bordello's french music yeah whatever i mean we throw hannah montana in the america room like everything else everything got us going so yeah hey that was that french rave music yeah and he's we get in the car with him and he's playing french music yeah hey uh jacob uh take me back to draft day you were drafted by the vancouver canucks 144th overall welcome to vancouver buds yeah buddy um yeah it was definitely a special moment um you know i got to be with my my family um i got to go home for that and um you know to be able to be there with them um they're a huge reason why i got drafted and um you know they've supported me a lot and uh to have everyone together we haven't had everyone together for uh i mean probably since like christmas to be honest so like last christmas so um yeah it was it was definitely a really special moment um you know i was kind of rooting for vancouver too and they're my favorite team uh the past couple years uh i like to hear that but i know i knew that give this guy the c yeah i was definitely rooting for him for playoffs and um tyler mott actually lives a couple miles from me back home so i knew him a little bit and uh growing up and he played with my brother a little bit um so yeah definitely a great organization i mean the fan base is unreal and like the second i got drafted it was just my phone was just going off with with fans and it was awesome to reply to them and um you know guys like me congratulating you and telling me to come on our podcast uh yeah it's just it's great it was a special moment tyler monroe i love a good guy too he's really showed that he showed this year that he deserves to be here and i want him on the team for the next few years for sure he's a great guy hard work and yeah he he works hard and um does all the little things right absolutely uh would you guys or uh did you know they were interested like did you talk to them much before the draft actually that's one of the teams i did not have an interview with at all like that was just a huge curveball for me um you know i got pretty lucky but yeah that was like uh one of the few teams that i i didn't talk to at all so um had you been to vancouver before no i haven't my advisors were telling me that you know it's a beautiful place and my grandma was saying that her mother that was on her bucket list to go to there so you know i've heard it's it's a beautiful place and just seeing pictures and seeing the draft there last year was um yeah it was it's great so can't wait to oh you're good you're gonna be a superstar out here buds everybody loves arkanox we treat them like super fans and i know they're great i i love the fan base good that's that's the right answer too that is the right answer sign this kid today yeah yeah do you guys have a go-to selly yeah yeah i'm mad i don't know yeah i'm usually pulling the arrow back into the and then when i get too excited that i scored i just like pumped my fist on the knee and i'm just like it's super awkward i'm like i'll go like onto a knee and jump into the boards i get [Music] we just had a couple of northeastern boys on before you guys uh aiden mcdonough and uh jayden strobel and they were asking about yeah we asked him about the shelly thing too and they were saying that uh tyler madden's canoe was probably one of their faves yeah no i just gave both those guys in the summer so they're good guys i've been like i've done the canoe in beer league but my go-to but my go-to one is john cena you can't see me and then one time i did the captain morgan yeah cam york's uh i mean i didn't see it in person but a picture of it him uh doing the violin playing the violin yeah god was that was pretty cool it was insane yeah thick that's i'm going to use that as soon as kobit stops and i get back on the ice yeah for sure what's been here guys is that quarantine snack go-to i mean maddie's is definitely ice cream [Laughter] yeah i mean he's got it probably um what is it oh man we're making you melt your blizzard i'm so sorry bro oh no it's fine it's fine um [Music] it's a great we've been ordering jacob's vegetables jake should be eating the ice cream right now i know honestly yeah he doesn't like ice cream he doesn't like sweets like it's it's insane he just he needs some more in his life who's the messi who's the messy roommate is it bordello no it's actually maddie okay okay it depends on the day i can be the cleanest roommate but i also like i have well these guys don't do any school like i'm always like he has harder classes that's i'm always doing school so like it always just ends up that i just make them like i'll make a mess and if i don't have anything to do obviously clean it up but then like a lot of times i'm like doing homework and i'm eating and i'm like doing a lot of stuff and then i just leave it there and it's like 1am and i'm like all right i'm just gonna go to bed that's all jacob will clean it up yeah i hey i got one for all three of you guys what's the best chirp amongst you guys oh man i mean those might be centered i don't know definitely you're allowed to smear a lot of square on here but and if and if it's too bad you want it cut out i'll cut it out i don't know um definitely this kid's mustache right now no no um who's the cook in the house me he learned how to use a grill like yesterday so and i've been using it since you gotta get one of these german grills yeah i know we actually just bought one yeah so hey maddie they can't be bitching if you're leaving a mess if you're the one cooking too man that's fair game that's what i thought exactly exactly yeah as he looks around like back to seriousness if a gm or skull were to ask what do you bring to the table what do i bring the table i mean i think uh a lot of people um told me i think i'm very versatile like my game i can play in every position and i like playing in every position i like playing i like my 200 foot game i like being on the pk power play and uh not only can i like play both ways but i'm can also produce offensively and i think definitely my hockey iq is one of my best attributes and uh just not only like making plays but also like knowing where everyone is and being able to read off that to put myself in a good position to score or help uh like make uh make a play for someone else's score and jacob how do you describe your game bud and what do you bring to the table yeah i'd say just like a two-way defenseman um i've been really working on like my defensive game the past couple of years so um kind of fitting in that two-way role and i think just like my offensive game um you know bringing the vision um i think that's a huge asset of mine uh the way i see the ice um joining the rush uh leading the russian um yeah i just say um yeah just that two-way game providing a lot of offense throughout the game um it's kind of one of my strong assets so the northeastern boys are all in fours you guys in forest too uh we're so we actually are they in houses they're in apartments right uh i think they said dorm rooms but i'm not sure yeah i think i think the northeastern guys usually get dorms or like apartments where here it's like more uh like everyone gets houses so like freshmen are all in dorms and then everyone else after that like after freshman year everyone moves off campus and lives that's like your sorority or like maybe you're on a hockey or like sports team you usually live with your sports team but like this year because of colvin um we decided like me boards and trusts since we knew each other like really well uh we decided to just move off right away and then we had a couple we have a huge class we had like seven of the guys in the door or six of the guys in the dorms and for the first like two months and then they were like oh my god it's getting like it's like a covered cesspool in there like everyone is getting gold it's actually it's toned down a lot now but in it was getting really bad at some point and they were like all right so they moved out so now our whole team is in like we have what five houses i think so we have like and it's not like it doesn't really matter ages it's just whoever wants to live in like which house we have a couple that have been in the team for i think we have six houses we have a couple that have been in the team for a while so we kind of just like rotate in there so like usually the freshman will go in and then seniors will graduate so things like that but we have like a three four six like all over the place yeah maybe yeah sorry go ahead no go ahead go ahead if you have a dream venue to play where would it be [Music] what a dream venue i mean i'd obviously have to go um i'd obviously have to go with td garden i mean i was like uh that was like one thing growing up i was like oh i want to play in the bean pot so bad but i can't do that right now anymore but i've kind of gotten over it but now i like now i really wanted to play in the garden that wasn't the ice cream was it that's my keys but yeah definitely in the garden where with all the bruins fans hopefully they're not cheering against me but whatever whatever it is i'd love to play there um honestly dream growing up um it was honestly yost um i would i'd say detroit but like i so draper was my coach for six years so i was able to you know like skate at the joe and that was kind of our home rank and um and then at the new rank we got skate there so um i kind of i mean that was a dream for a while but um but yeah yost arena growing up was uh definitely a rank that i dreamed of playing in um ever since i was a little kid so like even up to like a couple years ago like that's when i got to play there for the nttp that was my first time so um yeah it was it was amazing just wait until you tie them up and go out in the ice at rogers buds i know it's an atmosphere trust me the fans go nuts it's crazy hey and you know hey one thing if you ever end up in vancouver which we hope you are soon you look up in the stands i dress up as dawn cherry all the time if you ever seen like sportsnet he's always on he dressed up a dawn cherry like every second game that's awesome full suits the dog the mic like everything my hair my beard painted like everything that's awesome yeah i've been like looking up the rank and trying to see like every little detail i can and just getting excited about it hey one one tip two you want to be a fan favorite you ever score in vancouver make sure you ride the stick all right yeah yeah vancouver legend tiger williams all right i remember that hey jake and uh maddie uh we can't thank you guys enough for taking the time today for us and coming on we're huge fans of yours and obviously we're going to cheer you guys on for the rest of your guys's career it means a lot to us that you took your time today yeah definitely thank you you
	[Laughter] i love small upside guys i was like i was just like who's going to agree with me all the time i just need eventually tony will have it so dauber isn't ranking anyone that's taller than 510. yeah every everyone owen power 77 the only difference is i have hair oh you know what you know what i'm done with this i'm gone bye guys you're listening to dauber's draft cast with tony ferrari and the dauber prospect scouting team powered by instat hockey [Music] all right welcome to this week's episode of dauber's draft cast as always i'm tony ferrari your favorite ball draft analyst and the managing engineer of dropper prospects this week we have a very special episode for you after missing last week what i've done is record the scouting meeting from dr prospect scouting team we had it on february 28th um i've edited down a little bit cut out some of the stuff that doesn't necessarily need to be out there in public and stuff but uh the meat of the conversation's here um we've got almost three hours or more than three hours of coverage here so um it was a great conversation with all the scouts and i i it was awesome to have it's always so informative and so great to listen to all these guys talking and get some credit for their their hard works they've been doing a ton of hard work throughout the year so i want to give big i want to give a big shout out to the team uh on today's episode you'll hear sammy turpak uh dylan griffin e tu silton alexa potak mikael holm uh merrick novotny our new crossover european scout caitlyn berry braden olufsen jacob barker aj gudyro nick richard and unfortunately we also did have three members of the team that weren't able to make the meeting and danny tiffany jameson iwasiak and claire mcmanus i'm sorry if i butchered any of your last names i'm a terrible human being and i'm terrible with pronunciation but without further ado let's get to the meeting it was a ton of fun so i hope you enjoy welcome to the first draft we are not the first draft meeting but the mid-season draft meeting uh for the year because it's uh it's been a weird year and this is the what everyone seemed to deem as the mid-season point so it's been a weird year but um we're gonna look at the top 15s that we all did it last time and that kind of gives us a good base for where we're gonna go on that top uh top end of the draft so um names like fabian lucelle willie macklin yes for wall street matthew veneers luke hughes even um they've all been up there for first overall so anyone have a first stab at who they'd like to go up there because uh like i said this is this is more about your guys the team rankings and everything because my rankings went out and everyone knows i'm a fabian lucell guy so um yeah anyone have a first first stab at who they think should go first overall and maybe a little bit of a reason why i still think veneers that i haven't really changed from what i said when we did our top 15s i think like when you kind of compare or kind of weigh a player's floor against their ceiling i don't think anyone kind of has the combination of potential as well as floor that veneers has his game just seems like it's ready to translate right away i think he's not far from being an effective play driving center in the nhl no i totally agree with you there like veneers is the guy that if i'm an nhl team that's probably the guy i go with me being not in nhl team i'm more than willing to take the chance in safe having myself because it's not my job on the line but veneers really is like just such a well-rounded player um anyone else have any anyone else have any suggestions before i mute myself in the middle of a sentence again who ended up being our uh our consensus out of those top 15s tony do you remember uh the consensual yeah i think the consensus ended up being tied between eckland and lucelle i think veneers was like one short um and then jesper wallace that was in there a couple times as well but i think it was a tie between uh eckland and lucelle and like i said veneers was right there i could have easily chosen veneers myself too so um yeah it to me it's those three guys um yes for or yes for wall street as much as i love him i want him first overall um the reality is like no team is gonna take a goalie first overall because they're all cowards and like it's just what it is right maybe detroit gets up there and takes them but uh i think it's between those three guys so um mikhail maybe you talk about willie macklin i know you and i just talked to him so maybe we're a little bit biased in this regard yeah we just had a nice conversation with him uh i think when talking about veneers i think eklund is pretty similar in that he has uh like comparing floor to the ceiling they're pretty similar so um i i'm very torn between miscellaneous right now they're both like the the five we have at the top can of course all be number one picks but yeah i don't know where i leaned i think they leaned a little bit towards eccles now compared to before because i think he stepped up his game the last couple of weeks after having a quite a rough patch with the covid and appendix surgery and stuff like that now he's back on track and he's scoring goals and he's pretty much a standout player constantly in the shl which is quite impressive when he's just 18 years old yeah i think like even me like i'm the biggest fabulous doll guy around like i love the kid but the gap is closing for me a lot and eckland is right there now and like is i had like they were closed all the time but man like ecklund's really stepped up his game the last couple weeks like you said and i mean i wouldn't be opposed to putting my number one um veneers as well fabian lucelle to me like i i had him at number one on my rankings but that he is the the home run swing of the three i think so like realistically i wouldn't be shocked if he's the guy that falls in this group and i think i know myself aj uh punch the people we talked to and stuff we all kind of go yeah you know what like lucelle's sick but like i could see him falling to 12 on draft day just because some teams are crazy and they they don't see the production from him necessarily that they see from a guy like william eckland you know i think maybe a bit more of a projection than yeah like maybe there's a little bit more development left to be had with laselle and rounding out the rest of his game whereas eklund has kind of already got all those elements down where he's well-rounded and a dual threat in the offensive end he's kind of i think his vision and processing might be a little more advanced than lasalle's at this point but the the pace that lazell does everything with the speed the way he winds up and just carves through the neutral zone when he gets the puck it's hard to ignore that if he's also impressive with the cell that he he he's so flexible like if he's put on the first line he plays like a first-line wing winger he carries the pocky enters christian stone he tries to find his teammates and then when he's a fourth line winger he just grinds trying to win like four checks but down d and just get him like just do playing like a fourth line winner and i think that's very impressive for a 17 year old guy to just be able to adjust in the way he in whatever way he wants to like is he's needed i think that's one of the most impressive things with yourself as well yeah one thing that doesn't get talked about enough with lasalle i know a lot of us have talked about it but like the way he hounds pucks and uses his speed to not only generate offense but get it back for his team uh it's something that's underrated i think yeah i like his forecheck a lot like i've seen him he's so aggressive when he four checks and uh like even if he uh over commits he's got the speed to get back and get back into the play and maybe turn it around he's just exciting to watch like i really like him he's my number one as well i'm definitely on team tony with that but yeah uh i mean he could go within the top five for me but i'd really be pushing for him at one but i'm a fan of upside guys so joe roland i had this discussion there uh before well probably two three weeks ago and uh he abandoned us [Laughter] yeah open opening uh fresh wounds but uh in any case yeah no the one the one thing that he and i really appreciated about uh william macklin something that he opened my eyes to is the ability he has to make a decision you know within a split second of having the puck on his stick uh the puck can be gone and and it's in the perfect place it's not the most obvious place but it's it's the place where it needs to be and uh if if you just just watch for that in any kind of viewing of william macklin like that's i mean that's i think uh probably one of his most uh intriguing uh characteristics all right so i think we're all kind of set on those three guys as those top guys unless anyone has anyone else that like like to maybe push for number one um i'm more than willing to listen obviously um but yeah we've got to figure out what order those three guys are in here yeah i was just going to say so let's just let's just do a quick uh show of hands because that might be the easiest way to do it with these three guys so um if you think fabian lucelle goes number one put your hand up all right that's two so three oh look at that three i thought that was more than i thought um all right how about with uh william eckland one two three all right in matthew veneers yeah and then matthew benares wins it and like i said i think he's the guy that was gonna end up winning it because he really he's like the safest of the three right um so let's lock him as anna's are number one and we're off to the races finally and then and now unsurprisingly william eklund and fabian lucelle tied in this again so uh let's go based on those two guys uh william eckland for second ah fabulous all for a second why do we have to okay william becklin won william macklin won by one hand um i'm fine with fabian lasalle being at number three because like i said um it's one of those uh he's in the right day and it could be either one of those guys right yeah right like i'm trying to stay unbiased to how much i enjoyed talking to william eklund about half an hour ago so i i i'm sticking with my fabulous cell got but yeah like those those three in my opinion have separated themselves at the top of the class and and then i think we get to who i would at least have at number four um i don't know if anyone else is against it or for it but yes for wall stead the the ridiculously talented technically skilled goaltender um does anyone have any opposition to him being four because i know he was in the top five on almost every list that we did so any opposition to him at four i've got no opposition to wall stead at four he's my number five but uh the guy i've got at number four i feel like i'm probably a little bit higher on than the rest of the group here so i i've definitely got no problem with wall stead at number four all right beautiful i'll just lock that in then so we can get that and uh this is already going faster than last time so this is beautiful um all right now now we kind of get to that big group of defensemen this is uh this is the range that i think everyone's kind of debating between so let's quickly talk about everybody um who wants us to maybe touch on owen power because he's been so fun to watch at times and then so frustrating to watch at others it's it's a bit of a an up and down viewing with him i think i can chat about him a bit um just because i'm a little bit higher on him than a lot of a lot of people i talk to again i'm not high on him but i like there's definitely a lot of uh issues you see but for me i i see a very mobile tall defenseman that skates really really well going forward and has a lot of offensive upside and when you kind of look at those tools like and he's very very raw like you look at the flaws and it's like he gets pushed off the puck all the time in the defensive zone his decision-making at times is so so he sometimes kind of just gets like a tunnel vision like he'll get the puck and start skating and then like everyone no one else matters on the ice it's just him going forward uh so the flaws are there and i know the comparisons are being made too was it tyler myers was that the comparison and i i think he i think it's a little unfair for us to label him at that right now because there is still a ton of room for him to grow as a player and when i look at like his ceiling i think this guy could be an absolute stud at the next level i now i would probably look at brian clark or luke hughes before him but no no doubt if i'm an nhl team i would be pretty excited to work with him with my development team and see like kind of what kind of brain he has and if he's able to process the game at a higher level and just hasn't to this point but if he if he's able to the the raw tools are there if he's willing to get the commitment in off the ice and on the ice so that's that's all in power i i think you make a really good point there jacob about him being so raw that uh you know regardless i mean everybody in the draft is raw to some extent and he just has so much um so much gift in terms of his skating in terms of his size that if you're right if you can work with that and uh and and mold that that raw ability into uh the ultimate player he he has more going for him physically than so many other players kind of in this range well the one thing i always find myself asking or the one thing i always find that i'm asking myself when it comes to powers if he wasn't six foot six like does his skill set stand out does that ceiling stand out the way that it does just from looking at his measurables i i don't know i haven't really seen it when i'm watching power like i just think that the decision making leaves a lot to be desired um he does get pushed off the puck a lot for a guy of that size and that just makes me more curious about how much of a factor that's going to be for him at the next level yeah i think when i was doing my rankings and i kind of like i was sitting there and i think he was one of the last blurbs i actually did when i was like writing everything and it felt weird to have like the spot at eight not written while everything else was and i'm like i don't know what to write about him because i don't know what it was and then my wife's a big fan of final destination movies and those cheesy crappy movies and so i was like you know what i was watching it with her and i'm like oh my god this is watching owen power like it could be so good like he's a roller coaster right like you get on the road coaster you're excited you're happy like this is fun like when he's going he's got the puck on his stick like this this is a player that you really value like his straight line speed his puck rushing ability is like i don't think there's a defenseman in this class that has the same level of ability to generate the power that he does but then there's so many things i question about whether like he gets himself into the corner and you're like okay well what are you gonna do from here and he doesn't know what to do from there um i think there's so much more development on the mental side of the game for him because that raw package like like you guys have all said it's ridiculous like six foot six six of five whatever you want to give him 215 um he's a special package but man like there's so much outside of puck rushing and outside of um his length that really go into his evaluation because like you guys said defensive only gets knocked off here and there um if i find he's always leaning offensive like defensively in terms of like he's outstretched to get the puck he's not really kind of gapping up he's using the fact that he is a massive human being to reach out and try to knock the puck away but once he starts leaning forward that defendant or that puck carrier makes a move to the outside foot and and open power isn't able to kind of jump back in that way so um for me he's the him and edmondson are probably the guys that are are the lower out of this group of defensemen um mikhail you want to talk about simone evans in a bit because he's he's a bit of the same thing but not with the same flaws i don't think no they have some similarities in their flaws that you can see but i edison is a it's a little bit calmer i think on the top like he can handle a little bit pressure a little bit more than the power does um i think also edginson is a better defensive reading power right now the way anderson can close gaps and stuff is really really good i think that's one of his biggest strengths especially the defensive side um but yeah edwardson is uh someone i've been pretty low on like before but then after like in the new year in 2021 basically i've come to grow him a little bit better i'm going to like him a little bit better because i think he's shown that he's developing that he's like he's starting to show off some but he's working on the stuff that he needs to work on so you know but he's quite not there yet i think he's yeah somewhere around this range would be perfectly fine for him and yeah he could also be he's one of those these the players in this trap that has a high ceiling because he can be uh such a phenomenal fun player in the nhl if he hits everything correctly but yeah yeah edmonton's my top defenseman that's the guy that i have ahead of wall stead at number four i know that's probably a lot higher than most people have him and there are similar things that he has to work out like power has but i think the things that he has to work on are more easily rectified than what power has to adjust to and the way that edmondson has handled himself even though his limited action at the shl level i think he really acquitted himself well there like he's a he's a dynamic attacker like he can block a guy from the blue line and and beat two layers like in it in the blink of an eye and get into space to fire a shot or dish to his teammate like the the skating and size combination and the offensive skill i think like the ceiling for edmonson is so so high but he's a guy that you've got to trust your development staff if if you're bringing him in yeah what i have a little bit of issue with him is that his passing is very much hit and miss sometimes that he he throws pucks away a lot and uh sometimes he sometimes he finds uh he finds the correct pass or he finds the path no one's seen but a lot of times it's just like throwing the pumpkin open along the boards and down to icing and then they does that three times in a row and you're like what the hell are you doing but but then the next shift you take the puck steps behind the net and then you just get through the entire up position team you know so it's it's it's very up and down with him sometimes yeah yeah i was going to say i think the the thing with steven edmondson is is the consistency isn't there at all and and i think we're seeing him playing in the austen skin and he's seemed to acclimate himself there i think that's probably the best spot for him right now um well i think he he did flash a lot of things at the shl level um you noticed at times he did seem overwhelmed a bit at times and um he's clearly clearly too good for the junior level so i i think he's in a good spot now um i've liked him a lot since he's been at the elves fencing level so he's definitely a guy that i i'm definitely including in this range um caitlyn maybe maybe you can talk a little bit about brent clark too because he's another guy that like when he first went over to slovakia i was like watching games and i'm like what what does he do what are you doing man but like the last like after like probably five or six games he like something's flicked in his head and he just started going and he's been a lot better since then yeah he seemed to take a little bit of time to adapt i don't know whether that was like bigger ice or anything um but yeah uh clark he's one of those really fun defensemen to watch you know he has that uh offensive ability he has the ability to sort of drive the play from the back end um obviously his iq is is really really high super good passing i also think his uh defensive game is underrated i think all of his offensive talents get really touted um but i think he's really really good um defending the rush he's he's always in the right place his his gap control is great in that um yeah i think he's better on his own end than people kind of often give him credit for yeah i know you're a big fan as well jacob [Music] yeah no i again the same kind of thing when he first went over and we started watching games you're like oh oh no like this is not the same i i think i messaged you i said this is not the same brand clark that we watched last year he his because last year the one thing i had always loved about him is his just offensive and defensive instincts were so good and he could always just kind of he knew what was happening next he was always putting himself in the right position to drive the play forward and then cut out plays in transition for the other team um and then when he first went over it was it looked like a mess and you had no clue what it was but then uh he i i forgive it it was him it might have been often we were talking about but uh just making the point that there's a lot of factors going into like for when you first go over there you've got the big ice you're playing against men the quality of the league is so so like some teams are good some teams are more challenging it's a different style of play overall so when you're when you're doing that it's it takes some time to get going and then once he did get going he has kind of returned to his form and i think that the tools that he brings uh definitely have the like are translatable to the nhl like his instincts and close he can move the puck while while pressured so i'm not really worried about his game translating at all i think it's he's more of this he's one of the more safe defensemen in this range i think he he will be in the top four at the next level for sure and can run a power play and kind of generate offense for uh for whatever team drafts them so i'd i'd probably have them first in this group right here and then maybe luke hughes after but i know we're gonna talk about the rest but that's that's just me for that now sammy he's been in your neck of the woods so i know you have an opinion about him first couple of games just rough i he wasn't like like he looked he looked like deer in the headlights just didn't know his positioning didn't know the timing didn't know anything but then he figured it out slowly and he's from what i've seen even in ohl last year he's that drysdale type he's more two-way guy than people give him credit for he has um obviously his positioning i think uh nick will agree with me he needs to be worked on a little bit but uh yeah offensive instincts are incredible with him uh he out of those four guys we have in those in that range five four of them he has probably the best ability to jump on jump up in the rush and uh join the enjoy the forward group and he knows when when to jump and also when not to jump when to just stay back wait for his opportunity on a blue line uh make some play from uh make some play from there and uh yeah i i liked him seen uh ever since he figured the timing out because of the bigger ice the competition uh the physicality as well yeah i was gonna say i think one of the things that i noticed when i had him on for the draft cast and interviewed him and stuff the one thing that he said was it wasn't just about him adjusting to his new teammates it was about his new teammates kind of adjusting to him as well because um he knew that he didn't want to necessarily change his style of play in a massive way because this wasn't a full-time thing this isn't this is the temporary situation for him um so what he said is he's like it got to a point where like they were in meetings and he he was telling guys guys like you can trust me when i have the puck on my stick i'm not gonna turn it over i'm not gonna make some boneheaded play go up the ice i don't need four four people back in the defensive zone supporting me we want to score so let's get that puck up the ice and then him kind of acknowledging that that it wasn't just him that had to adjust it was it's kind of everyone having to adjust to him as well it was something that i found really interesting but like we said we can talk the thing is here with him there aren't many guys in slovakia who play like him yeah the the fastest game they don't they just pass back to the forwards and just hope for the best and uh they i majority of the guys never played with a guy of his offensive ability and sense so it took a little bit of time as well so he's he's definitely right to what he said i think he made a good point there tony like when you're talking about what you spoke with clark about on the game tape thing like when i first started watching him when he went overseas this year i found him really really passive and just kind of like sort of drifting around not really sure of his place or what he's supposed to be doing and he he really like became more assertive in his game and confident as the as time passed and i think when he is playing assertively and trying to take over the game his ceiling is as high as anybody's in this draft class yeah i think i'm not against any of that because i mean the kid his offensive instincts and like we said the defensive game with him i think it is improving and and you've noticed that big time in slovakia's he's willing to kind of engage those bigger players and the the adults right like that's one thing i talk about with them is like you're playing against guys who might have a kid that's only like three or four years younger than you like how like what is that like and and he said it's like it's just a different experience playing against guys that are just so much stronger in general like even though the pace the play isn't the same as even the ohl he said it's that physical element that he didn't have to deal with before that he's had to adjust to as well um but let's get to that last defenseman in this group of four that we kind of have and that's luke hughes um this kid he's got so much talent and skating ability um i i there is a lot of stuff that he has to reign in and kind of work on in that regard but uh i know dylan you're a fan of him so maybe you gonna talk about luke a little bit oh yeah he's uh obviously very young he's very mistake prone but he has so much skill uh his skating ability is great um so he's kind of like sitting down be like hey don't be going so crazy trying to do these flashy plays and calm down make a simple pass because his passing especially has been a problem uh that i've noticed uh just like every game will fire off a pass that just goes nowhere near anybody but uh just kind of calm down figure things out slowly and then his upside is you know it could be all the way up there with the best um but you know compared to someone like clark he's a lot more of a risky pick just because you don't you don't really know how well he'll be able to handle slowing down his play um but if you can just work with that there's definitely so much upside there yeah i think the thing with with luke hughes for me is like i look at all these defensemen and i go who's improved this year and i go oh and power's been what i've expected he's been he's been what he is and simon evanson's been up and down all year and i mean there are plays that look great and plays that don't look great but um brent clark i i found has improved a lot especially defensively but for my money luke hughes has made the most progress in terms of just uh his overall decision making like like dylan said like there's still that pass at almost every game that you go where the hell was that going and it just goes into being an icing or it ends up being a turnover in the neutral zone or something like that but like his ability to to read the play offensively and he's not taking all the chances he was at the start of the year at start of the year it was like he was a fourth forward on the ice board like for most part but um he he's reigned himself in a bit he's kind of made a little bit better decisions and uh defensively he's he's tracking much better there was a point early in the year and last year coming out of his u17 year where i was like man like his defensive play is just not where it needs to be because he he'd be on a guy he'd have good gap and then he just he wouldn't either never pivot or he would pivot way too late and the guys buy him way way easily and it was a concern but he's he's taken a step there so i like luke hughes a lot in this range i think kent johnson probably deserves a little bit of talk here too um the the skill is ridiculous and stuff like that so uh before we move out out of the this group of defensemen kent johnson probably does end up winding somewhere in between these guys um who wants to maybe talk about kent johnson's game and some of the things he does really really well number one jacob yeah yeah i was the one that had him first on my rank and so i could probably try to try to advocate for him a bit i he will not be first on my new rankings but uh i still i still absolutely love him uh he has a ton of offensive upside he has the ability in my in my opinion i i think he has the ability to be one of the most or one of the highest point producers in this draft class and like in terms of upside if he reaches it he can i when i look at like a fantasy draft i would probably be leaning towards ken johnson in my in my first round uh just because the offensive upside's there he's flashy he's incredibly fun to to watch play obviously there are concerns his top speed is not great it's actually worse than not great i think it's he's slow is the is the general consensus he's very slow uh when it comes to that but i i look and he has fantastic stick handling ability his passing is great his shot's fantastic he he has all the tools but then just kind of piecing it all together and the iq is slowly starting to come but it's taken a while uh he's decision making at times is very very bad and he'll he'll try to do something flashy when there's a really easy pass that could generate a scoring chance for michigan uh but the the big thing that i advocated for before uh with him is that he's coming from the bchl which is a league that we we all know he with a guy like him with the skill that he has he could do whatever he wanted in that league and it was never a problem he like there is not a single player in that league that could touch him last year and then kind of translating his game to the ncaa i haven't really seen him falter too much in terms of like do you see the holes in his game but it's not stopping him from producing and that could be he could be the benefactor of playing with maddie veneers that could be a a real thing and like because veneers takes up a lot of attention so that that could be legit but um when i look at what i've like i've seen him improve from dchl the ncaa i haven't really seen his production drop off so until i start to see him like not improve and what he needs to improve i don't think it's fair to just knock him because well he's he played a bad league and now he has some he has some holes and that's that's it like he he's shown improvement in every in every way so far at umish like from his first game to now i've still seen the improvement he's making better decisions he's starting to do less crazy things so as um as a year goes on i'm seeing him get more comfortable and when i look at that i'm okay you went from a really badly to a better league was and is still able to produce and he's still improving his game why wouldn't he be able to kind of do that through the rest of his career and he's still got probably another year or two at umish at least right like he's not coming into the nhl next year for sure so he has at least one more year at michigan before he turns pro which is another full year of ncaa hockey for him to improve and kind of get like learn learn a little bit more about the game how to how to produce in certain scenarios and then another year on the ahl and then he he'll be ready to go in that case so that's that's kind of my outfit like what i'm thinking for kent johnson again i would he's not number one on my list anymore because i realized that that's a bit of a stretch so i i've got them at around four or five on mine uh behind that group of forwards and goalies but um yeah i think you could probably slot them somewhere in between this group of four defensemen like maybe clark and hughes first and then maybe somewhere in that thing with power around that range in edmonton but that's that's my thought about it yeah my question is who do we think is the top defenseman of this group right now because my opinion is probably i i i bounce between clark and hughes every time but i i probably lean brent clark right now even though i know on my last ranking i had luke hughes there but like those two is so razor thin in the the improvement i've seen with clark's defensive game and just his ability to kind of he he was so good at directing traffic even over in slovakia you're constantly seeing his arm up in the air pointing directing guys where they need to go and stuff so um i probably brent clark but anyone else have any other player they want to make a case for at number five maybe i mean i have used second overall but it's just one of those things that's like like who you want there um so i'm not really concerned who goes over who but i mean i'd be pushing for hughes yeah i think like like i said on my ranking when i put them out last week i i had hughes ahead of clark quit five and six um i wouldn't be opposed to putting hughes there if if that's what the group kind of likes better because like i said those two for me are you toss them up in the air and i'll pick out whichever one falls to me right uh anyone have any specific uh favoring there otherwise i think we'll just go with what dylan likes and as much as i just like that fact eileen hughes because he's a bit younger like he's uh right at the end in terms of being eligible so there's he might be behind a little bit in development just because he is a little younger so there's more time we should wait a little more time and see what he can do that's more where eileen yeah i think the the youth factor with hughes like he's what like five or six days from being eligible next year so something like that yeah it's not much like he's a september birthday so it's gonna be one of those things where like yeah like the youth factor does play a factor um five and six hughes and clark any objections to that sweet all right now where do we want to put kent johnson in this group in this next group of three guys because i i probably have kent johnson ahead of the other two um but there's an argument easily for the other way around um uh alexa sorry i have i haven't seen a robot show my head of the johnson on my list as well but i'm not sure anyone else does but i like simulation a lot as a player and i think he's just stepped up and become better and better with this season has come as well because he's playing a lot in the shl but in a smaller role but he's his temple and his speed and his pace has gone up so much since like when i watched him in october when he played in the in the junior league in sweden so i think he he's a very special guy that i said i like a lot around eight so i just wanted to put his name out there alexa what's your take on those swedes there with edmondson and uh robertson yeah so i think edmondson goes ahead of robertson i think that evanston like we said he could go you know he he has a high ceiling but he's got a lot he's got to work on to get there and i think that i think it's kind of a maybe a more aggressive pick than taking robertson because you've really seen how his game has come together this season but i think i would go evanston over robertson all right so if we how about we go like this for for seven to nine we do edmonson power unless anyone has any like does anyone really want power ahead of ed vinson because that's not my opinion but like like i said this is more you guys than me so i'm more if someone really wants power ahead then i'm more than willing to push him there all right cool i have no objection big i have power above and vincent on my personal one but the gap is like literally non-existent between like first and eight overall yeah so whatever the group thinks i would agree with all right yeah i mean i know at least a few of us in this in this group i've had private conversations and power isn't the favorite of many of us so uh what if we went edmondson i don't want to go power johnson um what about like edmondson and then we start talking about robertson with power and johnson because i i think that's probably about where i'd go with the next group of guys and um i really like seymour robertson i know i've been pretty high on them all year even when i did the range for him i put him in the 10 to 20 range but i could easily see him kind of slipping in ahead of a guy like dylan genther who i mean has had a great start to his two game season but some people have wanted to push him into like top fives and stuff and that's crazy after two games um but no seven points i mean i know i know i'm gonna look like an idiot this entire thing's gonna go out and people are gonna be like oh look at that look at that bald idiot they're just freaking talking about dylan genther when he goes first overall in four months from now or something like but uh whatever that's that's what it is but no i i think i think owen power ken johnson seymour robertson uh too ratsu i don't want to forget about him either um uh e2 maybe talk about raw two a little bit because i think he's a guy that i hasn't getting any respect because he did have that terrible start to the year he was left off the world juniors and stuff so uh what's your take on him buddy well yeah he had a really bad start for the season but he's been a lot better now and he's been playing in the second or the third line i've got about with his brother um and they've been really good just no points maybe they have like a couple each but um he's he's looked a lot better now i think his step that he's taken since being left off that world junior team like i i think he was like legitimately pissed off about it and and i don't know if that was the motivation or what it was but since he came back to the uh to the legal level he's been so much better like just um just in terms of everything like yeah like you said he's not really producing a ton but um he is playing against men and he's i mean he played against men last year as well but his he's kind of like maturity to the game like he just kind of puts himself in the right spots offensively he's a wicked wrist shot so um he's the guy i think probably is in this range as well um but who do we want to go with that eight because we've talked about four or five different guys so someone give me a name for eight because if not we're just gonna talk about half a list and uh not making any progress here what did you guys do with um five six seven while i was trying to start up my generator there oh yeah nick nick out here working on generators i was powering up lost power we went uh 567 was hughes clark and edmondson uh now we're kind of debating between power johnson ratou simon robertson as well as in kind in that group so um it's it's a bit of a bit of a mess as most of this draft class is i i like i like seymour robertson here actually tony and uh you would kind of mention i'm a bit of a sleeper in this range but i think uh i think he's kind of a player who might might turn out to be a bit of a coach's dream when he uh when he starts to get get into the pro level i think he uh he executes tactical plays really well he uh he can play in in a system and and doesn't make a whole lot of mistakes and i mean relative to uh what else is available here i think that's i think that's a valuable thing to have yeah i mean i mentioned that he he's got like one of the maybe the best wrist shots in the in the draft it's ridiculous that he scores he scores from the blue line with his wrist shot like just beat he's to go keep it clean and no traffic and stuff it's just he's got a ridiculous shot yeah i think it was in the uh the swedish uh games that they played against each other u18 versus eight and not u19s um he scored a goal where he was kind of like falling down a little bit as he crossed the blue line and just fired it on net and it beat the goalie clean i'm like okay well that's just that's just what happened i guess because his shot is like wicked good so i mean i'm i'm not opposed to putting simone robertson at eight if that's where we want to go i mean there's definitely guys with higher upside available but um yeah he's a bit lower on the list but but i could see the argument for having him in the top 10 for sure but by the same token as putting veneers ahead of eklund and lucell i think uh i think it's a similar argument for for having having uh seymour robertson had a head of like guys like like kent johnson so how about we go simone robertson owen power ken johnson is anyone opposed to that uh kind of order there in the top ten too low for uh that's my one concern too is like i i don't love the idea of ratsu coming out of the top ten so do we push power and johnson down because that's that would be my first inclination power down below rather i think we can we can drop rather out of top then it's it's fine it's not he's not that good every time we do one of these things e2 comes up with one of those and just yeah let's put in the second round there are some concerns we throughout this game in my opinion i mean when he was in his trunks minus two season he was like so much ahead of everyone else and now i just feels like he feels like that he's he's behind everyone else and that's a bit concerning for me so where has the development been these two years and um he's still struggling with his like on the back game like there while while they're playing a uh cycle game in the offensive zone he he isn't really there he's he just goes in front of the net and stands there and i don't really like that i mean he he has pretty good spark skills so i think you should have like more confidence to use them also in legal level so all right i'm i have it set up now where it's it's power johnson wrought to it 9 10 11. um i i this next group is kind of like sure they're they're guys in this draft class i'm not in love with a lot of them um but i do think dylan gentler is probably going to fall too far if we don't put him here mr seven points in two games he's going to show tony wrong and all that stuff but um his biggest issue for me is is the pace of play kind of thing and his skating because he doesn't always move his feet and stuff i mean the last cup i watched the couple games he's played already this year he's looked better he's kind of active and getting going but i do still have a bit of an issue with his pace of play but i i feel like dropping him any further than this would probably be criminal because he he is a really productive player a really smart player um he's got his offensive intelligence should have him around this rage and that's just it right like he's such a smart offensive player that even if he's not playing at pace like he might be one of those guys that legitimately doesn't need to play at the pace of a lot of guys in the nhl he's able to kind of ramp things down himself um like i almost look at him as like a poor man's coal perfetti in that regard like i think perfetti's got a much higher ceiling and overall and everything but a better game in general but um they both kind of have that issue of pace of play like they like to get over the blue line kind of stop analyze things and make a decision from there but like i said his offensive iq and his just his ability to attack is special so i i think 12 is probably good for him and then we get into that group of uh isaac rosen cole stillinger chaz lucious zachary leroux fedorsfechkov uh my boy scott morrow like there's a lot of guys in this range that are kind of um up in the air so who wants to make a pitch for somebody at 13. i'd like to nominate oscar oleson here if we've got simone robertson in the top ten i don't think that you can really justify having olson a whole lot lower than him that's just my opinion i think the the skating ability the the two-way game it's it's easy to kind of project it to the next level i think he does a lot of things that nhl coaches will appreciate i just think he'd be a really valuable middle six kind of transitional guy who doesn't hurt you at the defensive end of the ice either yeah i think one of the really interesting things about olausen was uh at the world juniors he was held without a point and he got pulled from he didn't play i think one one or two of the games for sweden but uh he was still one of the most effective players in the entire tournament in transition so he's a really good player in transition i think he like you said both guns of the ice you can kind of affect things so um i'm not opposed to putting him here uh mikhail what's your take on him yeah i like him a lot uh he he's like he's good at almost everything or like a little bit of everything like he's got he's got nice hands he can like he showed at least in the junior leagues more than maybe in the shl but he's a nice handbag good skater got a decent shot you know and he's he played both both ends pretty well so yeah i like him a lot uh around this area i put him in i think my range was 12 to 20 but yeah i think somewhere around here would be pretty decent for him yeah i'd like to see him come in somewhere in the 13 14 15 16 range on this board i think he's looked really good um on his loan in the offspend skin so far and i think that even when he was still in the shl and getting really inconsistent minutes i think that he still was able to make the most of them and didn't really uh shy away from the adversity he was facing so i think that um yeah i'd like to see him falling around here i think like mikhail said he really can do a lot well all right is there anyone else anyone kind of wants to put above oscar ellos olosen um because i know i know guys that coal cylinder chas lucius have crazy high upsides like they're good goal scorers um isaac rosen's a fun guy but i think realistically he probably gets bumped down even as much as i love the kid but um oscar losing i'm fine with him at 13 unless anyone has any objection to that and wants to maybe put someone else up there first i have cylinder ahead of him uh i saw him his first few uh ushl games uh super skilled uh good shot but uh just thinking the game is such a big issue for him he gets tunnel vision so hard he just wants to do everything himself and then loses the puck doesn't play the defense much at all so uh i think if you're banking on the upside with him you can kind of pump up higher but i mean i'm not super opposed to dropping him because you know he's not really doing that well besides his offensive production really i think for this range i'm concerned by cylinder skating a little bit like i don't know that he has the ability to get himself out of trouble as well as some of the other guys that i mean not only out of trouble i don't know if he has the ability to get to the same kind of spaces in the offensive zone at the next level you can score from this the other spaces that everybody else can't though yeah yeah but you know that that's that's a good point tunic yeah yeah cylinder is a a really good player like it cylinders that guy like if he breaks like i wouldn't be shocked if he gets drafted in that at like 15 or something in in everything goes right he gets a little bit of a step off or step in his skating and he ends up being the best player in this draft class like i think that's a legitimate um a legitimate possibility with him because the offensive skills are so good um i'm concerned about his skating though that is a legitimate thing and i do worry about it but like the offense like i i am uh offense or upside leaning guy so i i generally go with the upside so i'd probably go cylinder ahead about lowest in but um i i can see it either way with those two guys so uh if we want to go uh a low since cylinder 1314 we can kind of look at guys at 15 and go from there just a genuine question here where are we sitting in terms of carson lambos are we kind of letting him drop into like the next tier of defenseman with like spazzle and um and those guys and chica are we gonna because yeah that's i i don't i really have an opinion either way it's i'm cool with whatever but i just want to know where we sit on him because if we want to put him higher then this is probably a decent range for him i want him to be good so bad i like watching him in the like even on my rankings i said it like most players i put where they're playing right now like i put whether they're playing slovakia for clark or slovenia even for paneli for lambos i straight up just didn't even acknowledge the fact that he played over in sweden or never happened never happened i just i i said it right in the in the blurb too i was like notice how i didn't say that he was playing for yip in sweden or finland because it didn't happen like there was just not even the same player over there like it was brent clark in his first three four games in slovakia but every game he was over there it was really confusing to me um i want him to get back to the the whl and just like tear it up because this this is a guy like i pushed for like in her first meeting of the year like i pushed for him right at one and two like i loved this kid's game coming to the whl last year and watching him in in finland this year was just such a head scratcher like i'd say i lost my hair doing it but i don't have any and like it's it was tough like i probably haven't like i had him down at 20 um and even that i felt he was being a little bit optimistic after seeing him play in finland because it was just such a stark contrast like i'm concerned about dropping him too far but i'm concerned about keeping him too high as well at the same time like i think he's probably going to be end up going a little bit further down unless anyone really wants to push for him i've got him outside my top 20 too just barely but yeah so let's get on with guys like chaz lucius who just kind of came back he's doing the dylan gentler thing where he's just producing like crazy in his first few games back and i mean not to the same extent as gunther but um chas lucius xavier borgo zachary leroux fedor svetkov i think somewhat enters the conversation at this point um so who wants to to maybe speak to one of those guys i've got xavier borgo basically tied to uh chaz lucius basically but i would i would put virgo just i mean a hair ahead of him probably i think when we did our top 15s i found out that there was a few others who seemed to be fans of him even more so than i was at the time but um more recently i kind of bumped him even ahead of uh zach laroux so yeah i think borgo is the guy out of the queue that i look at as the top guy right now because um i is i love zachary larue when he's playing his game and he's doing stuff like i don't know if there's a player i like watching more in this draft because like he's a straight-up sometimes like it's just fun to see him like go out there score a goal and then punch a guy in the face in the corner like it's just fun to watch but he gets suspended like every other week it seems at this point and i'm like what are you doing man so it's not even that he's i'm undisciplined in terms of taking penalties and yeah and stuff like that i feel like he's actually just undisciplined in a lot of ways like he uh he's smart enough but he he'll he'll run around and take himself out of position um to make a huge hit i mean and the hits are great but he takes himself out of position by doing so and i knock him to that a little bit but like you say a little just hunt a ton to love about zach theroux but just over the course of the year i've begun to see and appreciate a couple of the things that uh the rest of the guys here and what will be in one of them um do more consistently or yeah i guess more consistently than the rue does yeah i think in this range it might my two guys here would be leroux and or sorry not the borgo and chaz lucius um i i think lucious had a really good start to the like to his little year i know there was a lower body injury there were there was a lot of different reports so i won't get into exactly what it was but um he he's come back he is his skating is still a concern but it does look a little a step ahead of where it was last year um you're more concerned with his skating or less concerned with his skating than you would be with cylinder probably less concerned i think he's smart enough to get to to get to his spots with timing and anticipation better than cylinder i think stillinger's like got the skill level probably on him and i i think despite the fact that i think both of them have excellent excellent shots like some of the best in the draft class i think stillinger probably does have him a little bit beat there too but um i'm more confident in in his in uh chas lucius's game at least being a a second line scorer kind of thing whereas i could see cylinder at some point like like i said i could see him being the best player in the draft class but at the same time i could see him being this guy who's constantly on the third line and almost like a like i don't want to compare him to alex galchenyak but having a career like that where he has a few good seasons and then he can't seem to get his footing anywhere because whatever reason is he going to be able to do enough away from the puck to justify having him in the lineup for his offensive ability i think that's my biggest question still with cylinder and i've got lucious ahead of him because of that yeah like so i'm i'm thinking in this range we probably go or go at 15 or uh we're going 15 lucious at 16. um unless anyone has any uh opposition and wants to get someone else in there uh maybe it's fossils i know sammy you're you're big on zfozel absolutely but i agree with lucious and porgo being ahead of him all right so let's do that especially borgo because to me what i see is perfect complementary player and he doesn't he's not play driver in a sense but he does a lot of things to help the better player on his line produce he's very difficult for for defenders to get a get a beat on it seems like like he he's able to kind of like slither around the offensive zone without anybody really paying much attention to him and then um he just pops up you know in the back door and all of a sudden the puck on his stick and and either he'll shoot it or or he'll you know he'll get the goalie moving back he's never the best guy on his line he never will be but i think he's always would be the second best guy on his line yeah no matter who he plays with yeah i think what i kind of been saying to people when they asked me about borgo is i'm like he's the best second best player on his line in the draft right yeah if he's if he's the second best player on your line that's probably a really good line and i think he's going to be an excellent complimentary player at the next level like i look at him and i'm like man you put him with whoever like you put him with the nhl version of maverick bork and you're gonna get a good offensive player who's putting up numbers um so i'm fine with him at 15. lucious at 16. and then maybe we start to get into the conversation of uh scott morrow who's a crazy gamble i know a lot of people are not as high on him as i am i i'm super high on the kid but um comes into the conversation here um fedors fechkov as well i think is more than valid here uh dylan maybe talk about fedor because i think you and i are both pretty high on him yeah he's uh great defensively that's kind of where he stands up most compared to most of the forwards in this class his positioning is always great he uh gets physical along the boards when he needs to he's not exactly a big guy but he can kind of throw his weight around enough to free up the puck uh and then he in tight situations he almost always manages to get the puck on a stick and control it and leave wherever he is and then in the offensive zone it's uh he's not like super great or anything but he has a nice shot he distributes the puck well he uh he tries a lot uh which being on two terrible toggliati teams uh trying to push offense as dangerously as possible is always positive when you're playing with people who don't know how to or don't want to play hockey but they're just kind of there on the ice to fill space he has to be the one that does stuff and playing in the vhl that's exactly what he's doing but for potential issues with him uh he is in a bad system in russia the sea dogs have his rights and he is under con under contract quote unquote with the with uh toggliati i'm not sure how vhl contracts work i don't know how any russian contracts work it's all confusing over there but i think he's one player that if you can sign him right away and get him straight into the ahl that's probably the best move for you because he's not going to develop much more playing with people who are just there to get the puck to him so he can do all the work yeah i think with fedor it's it's you see the the defensive game you see how smart he is on that end of the ice and um the offensive game you're seeing start to come with with diff just different little smart passes and he's got a decent shot as well so um i think he certainly deserves to be in this conversation uh dylan how high would you kind of have him because i'm almost willing to say i'd put him at 17. um i i debate because i like isaac rosen as well so i might put him ahead but um fedor's right in this range i think yeah i've met 15 to 20 for my my range for him i think 17 is more than perfect for him he's just going to be a really good nhl player yeah i think like the intelligence he shows it in the defensive game he's kind of encouraging for his potential offensively as well just because he does think the game at such a high level he's able to see things developing in the offensive end the same way that he does when he's tracking back and you know working to cover in the defensive zone he's a guy i've got a number 15 on my list just because i think he's a really easy translation to the north american pro game just because of how responsibly he plays without the puck all right so unless there's any objections i think fedor at 17 is where i i'm probably going to land um anyone object to that maybe they want to get larue or i'm not thinking shiver cop because i think dylan and i are both on the train that fedor should be ahead of him um but yeah i think him at 17 is probably where i go as long as everyone's okay with that now let's get into the the zachary larue isaac rosen um brendan othman kind of that debate um i think it's fazel's probably here as well uh yeah svalza is a really good defensive guy i think he plays a good two-way game i worry a little bit about his offensive upside but um in the same vein of fatal or like i think with better teammates around him you might be able to get a little bit more out of him that way uh you know merrick maybe you want to talk about him yeah i would say like he can really surprise everybody because uh he's really dangerous uh i watched him like two days ago when uh he was very dangerous offensively his transition play is amazing and his skating and his vision is like what will make him really good defenseman so yeah i guess like in this draft he can really surprise everybody by being drafted really high or maybe you know i would i was thinking about it like it's maybe similar to ian isaac from the last year that maybe he can be picked in the first round or maybe even in the second round uh i'm not sure about it but as a defenseman i would like uh put him really high in this draft class so his vision instinct transition play and uh that's what makes him really good but i would like to see him uh shooting more that's what i would like to say yeah yeah sammy do you think this is probably about the spot for spazzle yeah i i think so yeah the main offensive guys who i would have hi are already above him so what i would say about swazil lately is that he's more of he's trying more offensive things as a flight he was more of a defensive guy uh earlier in the season but this year he's trying more he's uh more creative in the offensive zone and tries to tries to attack more from the rush which obviously he does that's his best quality moving the bug up the ice from either side because lately he's he's been playing more on the right side than left what i've seen in games so i yeah that's probably the right spot for him around 20 between 15 20. yeah i would maybe just add that uh i guess he is at the the confidence at the world juniors and like i also need to mention that he's been in the top check league since 16 years old and he looks really confident like gay by game so yeah i think maybe that's something we didn't touch on enough maybe at the top of the ranking when we were talking about guys like equine and laselle in comparison to edmondson or even like johnson and veneers compared to power the the adjustment for defenseman moving up levels i think is is more difficult for than it is for most forwards just being able to process the game and the way you know opposing forwards attacking on the rush and things like that everything's just kind of happening a little faster for defenseman so for a guy likes fosil to to be comfortable at the men's level and have so much experience there as a draft eligible i i think that's something that's uh really intriguing it's also huge for oh go for it in terms of development uh playing against the tougher com competition and playing pro leagues with guys who played in nhl like his teammate with peter mueller that teams know that uh guys like that don't grow on trees usually especially defenseman so i just i'm very high on him with also in that in mind yeah and he's also like playing in the club where martinez was playing so i guess like he's getting a good care so maybe yeah he can surprise we will see all right now let's get to some some of the forwards here i think deserve some some love and that's isaac rosen and zachary larue um mikhail and alexa maybe you guys want to touch on rosen and where you guys kind of think about him because for me he's probably falling a little bit too far at this point but i i totally understand why because he's small and he's super skilled and and that's always a concern for nhl teams but uh where do you guys see rosen i think he fits well around this area um i like his of course his offensive skills he's very talented skater is good with his hands but he can uh he can like he controls the puck very well in the offensive zone he's not rushing the puck like rushing a pass or rushing a shot away he can like settle down and carry the puck and try to control the the play a little bit i think he disappears a little bit too much still in in the games like he is not always he's not always there i'm i think he's he's just like a little bit up and down i don't think he's creating that much ear in the shl at this moment but i think he he has certainly the potential to be a very gifted winger in the nhl yeah i think that he's a guy that like you know you need a good development team to really get the most out of him because like mikhail said i've really been noticing even as of late that he disappears he's invisible some of the time on the ice and you just you're watching shifts and he he hasn't touched the puck for four or five straight shifts and you're wondering what's going on i'm a little bit bummed that he didn't get uh loaned out to the office fencing or hockey at on because i think that his ice time's gone way down as of late and i think that he would benefit from that but um yeah i think this is a good range for him but he is you know somewhat of a high risk pick with his size and some of the flaws in his game and braden where do you kind of you have larue in the same range here because i i think with with what he could be at the next level there is something that larue is different than almost anyone else in this draft so um letting him fall too far would be kind of a little bit of a a little bit of a sad thing too so you think that rue should be around here too as well no i agree i think uh with larue you also you're also hedging your bets a little bit right he can whether or not he does uh come in and translate some of that that skill that is in his game the uh you know he's got excellent hands he's got excellent ability to protect the puck in the offensive zone um but but like i say in addition to that you're hedging your bets a little bit because he can he can also slot into a lesser role he might might have an opportunity to develop an approach system you know once he ages out of junior that sort of thing um and and really flourish in in an ahl team ahl team excuse me um or even you know slot in our fourth line and kind of grow his career that way so i think i think you've got options with him for his development that way and then and then obviously the upside as well so i'm thinking with with rosen being a risk and in the rue being a little bit more of a guy that could play on the fourth line if worst case scenario happens right he'll make it um i i got larue at 19 and rosen at 20. any objections to that all right so let's move on to this next group of 50 players that seem to all be in this range roughly and um uh i'm just going to start with scott morrow and plead my case here um because the skating and raw tools of this kid are just ridiculous like he plays at shout out st mary and i've been very on the record in in most years of saying i hate high school hockey and don't draft out of high school hockey because it's not successful in most cases it's it's taking a lottery ticket in in winning another lottery ticket like that's not not the best thing you could do but with morrow the tools are so exceptional like his ability to change direction on his feet is just um i i saw someone post a side by side of of him at the blue line and kale mccarthy blue line and while that's obviously a pretty ridiculous comparison at the end of the day um the skating i think is is roughly the same level like i think that morrow's skating is going to take him far um his offensive tool said his skill is just ridiculous um he's a high school player though so the concerns are very warranted of where he's going to end up um there are some extenuating circumstances i i could get to that um off the show kind of thing and not uh reveal a whole lot there but um he's going to und next year they're a defenseman factory i think scott morrow probably deserves in this range um i know there's a few other people that have seen him so maybe someone else wants to kind of uh give their take on him too because as much as i like him i totally understand him being dropped down into even maybe towards 30. he's that guy where i think whoever ends up picking them especially if it ends up being in this range it's it's like that you know their hands are shaking over the button you know how it's gonna go right but um i got no problem with him being here either no i think the tools are definitely there like you said tony uh the biggest question is again like you said the level of competition and it almost looked like he's not challenged enough at that level most of the time and i'm curious to see [Music] at the ncaa level what he's capable of when there's a maybe a bit more urgency and he has to rely on his instincts a little more and it can't just like co-spy on being exceptionally better than everyone else on the ice um but i would like to throw in chibrikov here if we're going to talk about you know high upside and maybe boom or bust potential i think the the offensive skill of chibrikov and the transition game and stuff like that i i think he warns some discussion in this range too if we're going to be talking about moro yeah i was gonna say dylan maybe touch on that because i know you've seen both those guys so uh maybe touch on chipper cop first though uh yeah so when mikhail and alex were describing isaac rosen i was like are they just talking about chibrikov but in sweden uh he's small he has an issue of inconsistency uh but yeah there's a lot of that skill that you're gonna be seeing on twitter in gift format of him doing a super cool move and it's going to be really really cool on the eyes and then you're going to ignore that he's terrible defensively and that he's not really driving a line um they're just he concerns me because i don't think he realizes how small he is and i feel like he's gonna end up getting injured somehow like this uh he'll go up along the boards in the vhl and he'll just get crushed from behind because there's no way that him being five foot 10 161 is able to handle a hit from a grown man well he's kind of reckless all around i think a little bit yeah there's definitely not a lot like he's precise until he doesn't want to be anymore and then it's all that precision is out the window uh he sees open ice and half the time we'll just go straight towards them and get a shot off other time he'll go to the board and get himself pinned over there and eventually lose the puck because he's not winning board battles um but there's just so much potential and he's a player that you want to be really good but is he going to be uh like a guy that you would be considering like top 20 no not really like with claire's still on the board um just because he's not gonna be driving a line in the nhl he's going to be more of a player going to give the puck he's going to do a cool move and hopefully get the puck to someone else so dylan i know you've seen scott morrow too so would you have morrow ahead of him i have chipper cup ahead um but there's not much gap between them i'm totally for going whichever way uh it's just i guess development uh chipper cubs obviously with ska that's you know best system in russia probably uh moro you know you got him in the uh high school and he's going to college next year i'm assuming yeah yeah uh so i mean it's just kind of flip a coin and pick whoever you want i love this too i'm not uh super convinced either way yeah i think we should talk about othman and lambos and maybe even to amala and shayca here but one last point on morrow i wanted to make is you guys all know i've been very against the draft being moved back i think it's idiotic and and so many other ways but i won't harp on that too much but with scott morrow he's the one player i look at and go if the draft does get moved back he's the guy i want to pay attention to most because you will see him at und next year if that if that is the case and um like i said for most players i think it's pretty stupid to do and stuff like that but with morrow maybe that is a benefit for him if that does happen and and maybe him playing at und next year might even push him towards the top ten like closer to the top ten um at the same time if we're going on the fact that the draft is happening in july like i think the premise that we're kind of using here is and there are concerns there um maybe caitlyn want to touch on brendan othman a bit because he's been a guy that um i've liked and i have him in this range every time i kind of look at my own rankings and stuff like that as well yeah i kind of have them in this range as well although i think i have them second among hr people on my list um so othman he's he's he's one of those scoring guys he um but he's not just that kind of one-dimensional score like his shot i think is one of the best in the class maybe um but he can also score in a lot of different ways his offensive zone vision is super high-end he's really really dangerous when he gets into the offensive zone um he can he can find lanes for himself and passes for others i think his playmaking um was a major thing on flint last year and i think that kind of got underrated in the face of the scoring i think he's really good there um he also he's hard to play against he plays that kind of physical game he four checks hard um he has kind of some potential to be a two-way player if he kind of rounds out his defensive game a little bit and there are like concerns with his skating um i think he's got a lot better acceleration but there's little bits in this game that need to be worked out right now i almost had hoffman in my top 15 um those pieces and i tried really hard to put him there but uh at the end of the day he he just slipped out of it and i i think exactly what you said caitlyn like in terms of his skating there's a little bit of a concern he doesn't have the prettiest stride and he doesn't really have an awesome top speed in transition but um i think he he's a factor in in more than one way he can he can get a little physical he's got really good intuition um and and absolutely has a great shot he scores from i found a lot of low percentage areas where you wouldn't see other guys scoring similar to maybe a coal cylinder but but maybe not quite yeah i know when uh i did the interview with him and jacob joined me for that and we talked about to to othman and the kid was like a hockey junkie i think to this day that that's still the longest one i've done so far and while most of them end up around 20 25 maybe even 30 minutes for a long one uh othman's i had to cut down from an hour to 45 minutes because he just he was just into it like he he loved talking hockey he loved um just kind of talking about the minutia of his game and stuff so um i i think the intelligence that is there with him i i tried to get him in my top 15 too um i toyed with it i put him up i took him out and i i ended up settling with him out of it but um even though i'm talk we talked about scott moore and chipper cobb like i wouldn't be opposed to putting brennan offman ahead of those two guys um uh is there anyone else anyone wants to talk about in this little grouping here or are we good to kind of uh make a couple uh picks for the the rankings here we have a representative for logan stankovin because i feel like joel was like a huge huge stankovin fan and that was yeah i don't know if we i i will say logan stan coven deserves to be in this range um this the knock on him is he small um he's a ton of fun though like this kid is a buzzsaw he he reminds me of uh of tyler tulio from last year who i was super super high on but the skill level is just way higher um i think the shot is ridiculous with this kid like you you don't expect a 5857 kid to have a shot that can beat a goalie from probably outside of the blue line to be completely honest like he's a really offensive player and his motor never stops like i'm a big stan kovan fan he was going to be probably the next name i brought up because i keep trying to push carson lambos down um but yeah i think stan coven if we want to get him in this range either i'm not opposed that in any way shape or form yeah i wasn't saying that he would have to be ahead of any of those three guys but i was just just thinking yeah like he probably does deserve to be in the conversation and maybe just tail tail off on half the blizzard maybe yeah i think the one thing with stan coven is he is small like he's is he's listed at five seven uh or five eight and it's like there's not a ton of uh guys that small at the next level i'm excited for him to get back with the whl um i know the bc division is kind of still up in the air but i i it sounds weird but i'm looking forward to seeing what they list to matt on his height because if he's five nine five ten i think teams look at him a lot differently than they do at five seven five eight um i would have no problem putting him in that group of three especially if i'm willing to take that that risk on morrow um i i think logan stenkov there's as much risk with him because probably less risk because he plays in the whl even if he is small so um what if we kind of went um othman morrow stankovan chibrikov and any objection to that all right so now we get the to the carson lambo samuchuamala um e2 maybe you want to talk about tuamala a little bit because he's a guy that you and i have kind of not necessarily debated on but i think we've both kind of been on the side of he's good but there's there's a lot else there yeah i think his upside is really high um because he uh mikhail told us said that robertson has a really good shot i don't know maybe duamala is better i haven't seen robertson but um he has he's a really really good sniper and he's an excellent skater and i think that his his upside is really high but there's some concerns his defensive effort is really lazy uh but it doesn't really matter i i heard that some some one of the scouts said to me that sebastiano had a really bad defensive effort in his draft here when he was playing in juniors and that's almost like these guys aren't finished products eh yeah i don't i i'm not too concerned about that i think he he's just too good to the junior league but not good enough for legal level maybe he should play in maestis and when he's at his best he just dominates he can you know he can keep the bug like for 30 seconds and then shouldn't score but um yeah he's a bit selfish also now dylan talk about danielle shaika a little bit uh he's super super defensive um the offense isn't all that much there but he's definitely in this range yeah i was about to bring him up uh he's been hovering through all three leagues in russia uh he's gotten quite a few games with chesca and he's looked solid defensively and then there's just um you're wondering how much offense there is and it's like well he can probably just pass the puck in the offensive zone and leave it at that uh he shoots a lot that's always been my concern with him he had a rough world juniors and i think people bumped him down a lot because of that but i think that this team russia system in general was not kinda him um everyone was just spamming point shots on a team and they're all getting blocked and they were giving up scoring chances because of it um but he's a great skater he's solid in transition he's going to get the puck from the defensive zone into the offensive zone somehow he doesn't really play super physically he's more of a i'm gonna get you where i want you and then i'm gonna get my stick in there and i'm gonna get the puck out with my reach uh because my arms are way longer than yours and i'm gonna get the puck um so it's just how much offense is there gonna be because he's definitely a player you can put in the top four in the nhl level and he's gonna be rock solid defensively he's gonna take up a lot of space on the ice it's just where's uh like how much of a black hole is he gonna be offensively and i think if he just develops continuously um his skating is already great his passing is you know fine in the offensive zone could still work on getting a bit more dangerous passes there instead of you know point to point and then risking that past getting intercepted and giving up a breakaway but just working under pressure and just kind of refining everything that he has yeah i don't know if there's another player in this draft class that loves shooting into shin pads more than denil sheikha but yeah we'll get to him maybe um like danielle shaikh is a guy that uh his defensive game is so good like he he might be the most mature defensive player uh on the blue line in this draft so um i had probably put him in this range him to amala um we get the carson lambos as well who i've continuously tried to keep pushing back a little bit but um i have a feeling that caitlyn might like pinelli in this range yeah i was just going to say let's let's get pinelli in there as well and and maybe talk about uh yeah i think pinellas probably the last one in this grouping at least yeah um i would definitely have pinelli in this range for me um it's a kind of razor thin edge between othman and pinelli for me um arthur wins out right now um but pineally is just one of those just versatile guys he's a real jew like dual threat he has that shot um he has great play-making ability that often goes kind of underrated although i don't think that's massively on display in slovenia right now um he has started actually picking up his scoring in slovenia now after struggling a little bit um i wondered initially if it was just because the first game he started really scoring and he got four points was against a junior team but he's he's kept on without scoring now i think he's realizing that if he wants to get things done he can do it himself he's not looking for that pass quite as much anymore um but yeah he's a really really responsible player he plays a kind of complete 200-foot game although there are some kind of things in the defensive zone and i think he needs to work out um but yeah he he's a a huge threat when he comes into the offensive zone in kitchener last year whenever he had the puck on a stick in the offensive zone you knew something was going to happen he was either going to make great pass or he was going to score and that's pretty much what i've seen from him yeah i think my thing with pinelli is like you see the mind is there like there's no doubt that he's able to think the game and kind of diagnose what's going on in front of him um my biggest thing with pinelli is when he's moving his feet he's a good skater he's not a great skater but he's a good skater he just doesn't like moving his feet all the time and that's a concern like there's so many times where i'm like if if he takes two steps he could get to that loose puck or if he takes two steps he's able to make that play defensively like caitlyn said where like he's almost there as the as a complete 200 foot player um in this range though like looking at the guys coming next and looking at the guys in this range i i probably put him in there probably ahead of lambos like i said i think lambos probably caps off this range but um if if we go like something like tomala shake up pinelli lambos anyone have any objections to that no i think that's a good spot for lambos to fall in all right so tamala sweet all right now this next range is is like i joked earlier that it opened up but it this this range really does open up like once we get into the guys like ryder korazak sebastian kosa dylan duke ayrton martino mason mctavish uh course and coolman's is in this range probably at least in the conversation um but it's a it's a big group of guys so anyone have any guy that they want to maybe uh put put a name for maybe this is the perfect time for braden to talk about zachary bolduc being a first or fifth runner yeah well i was actually gonna bring up zach dean but but i mean to go along with that yeah um there comes a point where we should definitely talk about zach balduc and um everything that he is and everything that he isn't i guess um but i know that's kind of the the joke or the running joke but um i was just talking with uh with nick well this morning a little bit about him and uh to be to be honest i have him closer to the the top of this range now at this point um there was a time probably around christmas where i was like this guy yeah is like a fourth rounder i'm really not impressed with his effort i'm really not impressed with his defensive play but but now i think there's just too much um too much raw ability too much foundational ability to ignore in terms of his skating in terms of his puck handling there's there's not a lot of guys who are able to rein in a really terrible puck at mock chicken um blowing up the the wing like he does um and he does it more consistently now than he used to i think i don't know what changed when the qmjhl went on hiatus for a little while and and now came back but he seems like he's a totally different player now so um really i mean we could we could have him here but we could we could wait a while i don't know it depends if there's anybody that is any that anybody else is really in love with and provides a more consistent um you know supply of whatever their skills might be this might be a good spot for them but tony i know you and i talk to like there is a certain concern that you have to have about a player being so inconsistent and you know even if he is or does seem to be an invaluable player right now in a lot of ways um if there's these ebbs and flows um game to game or month to month that sort of thing um what do you do with that i think with the queue that's an interesting thing because the the q season itself has been such a roller coaster you know guys getting ramped up and then being forced to shut down and go weeks between games and things like that um bulldup's interesting i got him a little bit lower than this range but i think like the i like his skating i find he's got a really clean stride it's powerful i like the way that he affects the game in transition both ways like i find lately he's really tracking back through the neutral zone a lot better getting inside positioning and you know kind of being able to lift sticks and grab pucks from behind he loves the stick whip like he he's a big big big time uh stick checker like you know he and maybe it's because he has the the reach to do it but i find like nobody stick checks more than he does yeah but he's been quite efficient at it from what i've seen lately anyways and i like his his shot too i think you know he can beat goaltenders at least at the q level from distance so you can beat them cleanly uh i think there's a lot to like there but he's like definitely kind of a project um in this range i know i just kind of made a dig at him when we were talking about the last group but i do have course in coulombs in this range i just think like if if you're willing to put them with your development staff like the tools that that kid has got as i see dylan shaking his head at me here but i i'd like the offensive ability the decision-making is definitely questionable but i think that's something that can be improved upon with his skating ability his willingness to play physically he moves the puck well he's he can beat the first layer on the floor check by himself before addition to a teammate in the neutral zone i just think there's a lot to like there but he's maybe one of the more risky guys in this range i'm happy to jam in uh zach dean and mason yeah i've got him any time i've got zach dean right around here too i i was gonna bring up mason mctavish because i'm definitely not gonna be the one pushing for him in this range because quite frankly i'm not a fan to be completely honest like his shot's ridiculous like that's a good tool but like i question almost everything else about his game um so i'd love for someone to try to convince me that he's he's better than i think because yeah i'm just not a a huge mesh mctavish fan despite the fact that i think he's going to make an nhl paycheck on a power play for sure uh i'll push because we've had the conversation before too and i've sent kind of my piece for that i still think mace mctavish has the upside to be a first-time player or at least in the top six in the nhl uh yeah you're right like his shot is unbelievable and even just um where they've got him playing right now um he's in slovakia with brandon hoffman which is kind of cool uh they're on the same team but um they they've got him up front of the net a lot not even just uh on the power play but just in general like his his job kind of on this team is to get in front and like cause havoc and he he actually does it really really well so when i when i look especially in this range um also when we were talking about um bulldog and dean it's a it's the exact same things it's the the upsides there the raw tools are there but just the consistency is is off all the time like it and not even like game to game consistency it's shift to shift consistency with mcdonald's like this times i sent tony a clip i can send it to everyone but there's one play where he just absolutely dominated in transition like made a perfect like perfect cycle gets the puck goes through half the team and then gets a great shot on goal and i was like holy crap like that's an unbelievable play like this is this is fantastic this is what he should be doing all the time and then the next shift he just stands on the wall and does nothing in transition for 30 seconds and they struggle to get in and he did nothing so the upside is there it's just the work ethic is just completely inconsistent but for this range where everyone is kind of a gamble i think he does have the raw tools and then he has the nhl frame he can play physical he brings something to the power play he has the offensive instincts and he can he can produce upfront i think it's worth it for this range of guys like mason mctavish like i said i think he's going to be an nhl player like i have no doubts about that pretty much um so based on that maybe i could i could see him in this range and stuff but like i have real concerns about his foot speed and maybe that is just the consistency thing like he just doesn't try sometimes um but like there's a lot of times even in the defensive zone where i'm just like he's just standing around doing that sitting on the wall for 30 seconds and you don't know what he's doing and part of that's i'm sure part of it's his uncomfortability just going over season in learning a new league learning a new team and and playing with players who maybe don't speak the language that he speaks as well so um he's a guy that i think definitely should be in this range i'd probably push him down a little bit further but again like i'm more than willing to let you guys make that decision because yeah like the i admittedly i'm not a maze mctavish fan so i don't want to be the guy on him either he hasn't played very much this year um he's got like a handful of games so the kovid has maybe hurt him more than a lot of other players uh his rookie season in the ohl was pretty impressive it started off strong and kind of cooled down as the season went on but the pete's were a pretty stacked team for him to have the impact he did as a 16 year old rookie um made a pretty strong impression for me and at the end of last season i was really high on him and i just wonder how much of of of you guys shared that sort of opinion about him at the time and has he just been surpassed because he's not playing i think that's definitely a factor for mctavish yeah like him not playing definitely factors in for in a lot of people's rankings but like even going back and like looking at my list from earlier in the year like i had him 29 20 like 30 31 like almost all year and even on my last list it was at 32 like i have him at the end of the first round so it's not like if we put him in at 27 it'd be crazy high for me or anything like that um but i do have concerns about his game whereas like a guy like ryder korzak like who's also in this range i think he just plays a bit more of a complete game he has that that skating issue similar to mctavish but he he works through it because of his work rate is just being so much higher um i think ryder korsak is a guy that deserves some mention in this range because he does he's a dual threat he does everything in the whl he's not great defensively but um no 510 511 player really is in the whl because it's such a physical league so i think ryder korzak's a guy that he he's able to score he puts up tons of numbers and and i think there's a lot of the the connor zerry effect that zerry got last year like a lot of people knocked his scoring totals because he was such an older player for the draft class and with ryder korzak and maybe that does bump him down but i don't know how much further bumps him down than where we're at right now um if everyone's kind of in the same conversation there maybe we go mctavish korzak if everyone is okay with that unless somebody or maybe even mctavish dean korzak or dean mctavish korzak i'm i'd like to throw matt coronado in here too i know he's a player that you and i have talked a lot about in recent weeks tony i just think that you know the way he's been able to sustain his offensive production this year and kind of keep improving as the season goes along i know he's one of the older players in the class but there's just some offensive tools there that are hard to ignore um i don't know if anyone else is comfortable with him in this range but i think if he can you know he's he's a fine skater when he has some room to get going i think he's able to like kind of carry the puck through the neutral zone if he's presented with space and can get ahead of steam um maybe needs to add some of that explosiveness like he me and tony talked about this a lot he kind of gets caught on his heels when he's standing still and it limits his ability to kind of like get off that first quick step and you know jump into a different area but he does have the awareness to kind of like see those spaces in the offensive zone and and make himself available for passes and his shot is just it he's got a really good shot compared to a lot of the other guys in this draft class i think he's going to be able to score at the nhl level and probably deserves to be in this conversation right now too yeah i don't have anything against matthew coronado being in this conversation either um if we're gonna put him in there though i think ayrton martino deserves some credit in here um i know there's a lot of people who are either super high on him or super low on him um he is an all-out offensive guy like his defensive game is okay i guess like he's active in skating defensively but he doesn't really know where to go in i don't he's played in three different levels in the last year he was originally in the ojhl uh went to the bchl for the preseason and then went to the ushl when the bcho shut down after that and um he's been great for omaha in my opinion one of the most dangerous offensive players and one of the most skilled offensive players in the ushl period so um aj maybe i know you're a fan of him so maybe you gotta give a little bit of take on him i like him he's offensive he's got a lot of upside uh i saw him score on a peak on a penalty kill which was pretty fun uh he's just got a lot of skill yeah i really like them and i was going to bring them up so yeah yeah i think this range is really really wide open so what if we go something like um mctavish because everyone outside of me i think everyone seems to be a big fan of mctavish so we don't can i make one more note on ball duke before we maybe go for tony like if we're considering what players are left i don't know i would i guess i'd ask everybody else to comment on this but balduc is a guy who i think if if things go well for him he could be in and he could be an effective player on the first line in the nhl um i don't know if there are any other players remaining that fit that bill that being said he could also totally miss um and there's that that risk but i think the other guy you mentioned zach dean is probably maybe has that bit of upside i don't know exactly i don't know if i would yeah if i don't if i would classify zack dean as a player with like a first line upside i definitely think he has less risk of missing because i think you know shift to shift he is more consistent he he applies himself in a four checking role really well which is something i haven't seen quite as much from bald duke but dean i think i would feel a little safer about um but i wouldn't ever necessarily expect him to uh develop into a really effective first line player like volduk maybe could no i might have jumped the gun there a little bit but i think um just like the uh as a complimentary player perhaps maybe not in a top-line role but i think he definitely has the potential to do that in the top six for an hl team he's always hounding pucks i think if he can maybe learn to slow the game down a little bit and let things come to him more often rather than just playing at 100 miles an hour at all times i think there's definitely something there for kind of a two-way forward who can chip in offensively yeah i i guess it's just it's the question of philosophy is are we are we do we want a player who seems like he could contribute in multiple ways and potentially play on your second line um or do you want a player who's risky and could potentially play on your your first line all right so what i have right now is uh 28 mctavish 29 korzak 30 ayrton martino and then i'll let you guys make that you know i'm going to put martino at 31 in between bullduck and dean and braden you're the qmhl guy i'll let you decide who's at 30 and who's at 32. yeah you got to do it well that then it's yeah for me it's zach dean i guess um ahead of all duke and and um i'll maintain that philosophy i think for for a while so i'm even okay with with dropping ball duke a little bit more if there's someone else who fits a similar build to zach dean like um i guess i'd probably like to have coronado ahead of bowl duke still at this point yeah yeah like like i said like he's still got that that range where i don't know if you really don't like him and you really you really see um those flaws and the inconsistencies as a big factor he could go you know as late as uh the mid to end of the second round but um there is that there's that that carrot of him potentially be a really impactful player all right so how about we do it like this then um so 27 is pinelli that's where we left off 28 carson lambos uh 29 mctavish 30 korzak 31 dean 32 martino 33 coronado and 34 uh zachary bolduc i'm good with that all right now we've been here for a very long time already so let's take a quick bathroom break because i'm fidgeting over here so uh let's take a bathroom break and grab a drink grab a coffee grab a snack or something and meet back in like five minutes how about that all right well the team's grabbing a quick drink and getting a break i figured i'd jump in here real quick just to give a shout to instead hockey they've been helping us all year long and we've been lucky enough to partner with them to help scout and evaluate players from all over the world in a year that's not really the easiest thing to do so instead is as everyone kind of knows by now is one of the best platforms out there they've got a wealth of player data team data and incredibly database of video they're the elite of the elite when it comes to aiding and player development scouting and analysis for any team or organization looking for help looking for a way to get an edge instead hockey is the way to do that and if if you can think you your organization can use it definitely reach out to insect because they're always looking to add people to their team too let's uh let's get back into this now that everyone's taking their little break and dylan's dylan's walking around but he's not important anyways so i mean you left them all i think you left them off uh the like i think you forgot to mention him in the last uh podcast for uh the rankings too i did i definitely did i noticed it afterwards he messaged me he goes you didn't even mention me i'm like ah probably on purpose that's what i figured uh all right so now in order to keep this from going for five hours and making sure that we all have some part of our sunday to deal with outside of seeing my face uh let's just start if someone wants to vote for somebody in this next range um we're outside the first round now there's a lot of diverse like divisiveness with a lot of these players um um sasha pass another guy like that um dylan duke as long as we get him ahead of passage off i'm i'm fine with um but at the same time like claire who's not here unfortunately she she's not completely the opposite way she's a fan of past job over duke um so let's start there with the two american guys before we get to the goalie um does anyone have any opinions on passenger versus duke because these guys are are the two best offensive players pretty much they play on the same line a lot of times for the nttp um anyone have any opinion on one versus the other i've got duke far far ahead of pastor job i just i don't think pastor john plays with enough pace he doesn't seem aware defensively at all he appears disinterested when he doesn't have the puck um we talked about this a bit tony i think he probably makes a living as a power play guy yeah the next level but at even strength i don't i think he's probably gonna do more harm than good uh i definitely like duke a lot more than pass the job duke competes hard he he gets in tight he's got good hands around the net he he does a lot around the net i think he's probably gonna make a living there in the nhl with some power play utility and yeah i just think he he uh translates to the next level a lot better than pass the job does yeah my thing with those two guys right now is like neither of them are good skaters like let's just get that out of the way like right off the bat like both of them are probably slightly below average skaters um but the thing with dylan duke is he works around it like he's able to get his feet moving and get going so um i think they probably should be somewhat close because past job does have that offensive game that like i said like one shot or one pass from him can really change the game and put put a puck in the back of the net but i probably favor duke um we could probably push past the job down a little bit um especially with guys like kuliman salman and uh vince nyorio and evan now it's kind of coming up as well mackie samus i know there's a lot of big fans of him where's everyone at on tai voight i think he's probably in this range too i love typhoid like he was my guy coming into the year um i thought i was super high on him when i had him in like the 50s at the start of the year and then i seen like elite prospects rank him in the first round i went okay i guess i don't know his size is a huge issue for me though and like i'm we joked about me being like wanting to rank only guys under 510 but like his size is a real issue despite the offensive tools yeah i love oh sorry go ahead caitlyn all right i'm just gonna say i'd yeah i'd agree with that i i'm also really high on twitter i haven't quite had my list um he's he's one of the guys is always moving really good movement uh obviously he can score he's always involved but i i see him get pushed off the puck like so often and it's kind of okay at the ohl level but his size and his strength are just massive issues here yeah i i like typhoid i think we're going to rank them i almost guarantee we're going to rank them but like probably a lot lower than where elite prospects had about like i think they had them at 20 24 or 25 like to me that's just such a big risk especially like even the guys we're talking about in this range like dylan duke and and even sasha passengers who's not a big guy or a great skater by any means but he does have that one-shot ability to change a game kind of thing so um i'd kind of be pushing dillon duke here um vince niorio would be my next guy probably if if it's not samu salman um he's the guy i've really liked uh e2 and i have talked about times i think i'm a little bit higher than a2 is but uh what's your take on salman anitu um i think his problem is his skating other than that he's a really good player he hasn't played in like like three months i think because of the covet situations are different in different areas in finland um but he's a really smart player and he has really good offensive tool set but the skating is probably the thing which is dropping him the most um what what comes to his effort it's really good and he tries to defend a lot but he really doesn't know how to use our position stuff but most important thing is that he is he has a good effort also in the defensive zone and he wants to learn all the time doesn't really matter if he isn't that good in that area at the moment now one of the things i always like to do when i'm looking at a list like this is i look at a guy like brent johnson and i'm a big fan of brent johnson i like his game a lot but like and then i look at the guys that we're kind of talking about and i go would i take brent johnson ahead of these guys and i look at guys like sebastian kosa probably not dylan duke probably not passive job yeah probably brett harrison maybe uh coursing coolman's i'd probably take brent johnson above him because i think there's a bit more refinement despite coleman's maybe having a bit more offensive pop um so i think brent johnson deserves to be in this conversation but um who we putting at 35 are we gonna go with dylan duke there i think it's gotta be between duke or sebastian cosa for me yeah i like duke all right cool so duke's at 35. um before we get moving on too far i do want to talk about sebastian kosa a huge goaltender i think he's six six or yeah six six two twelve yeah so you you do worry about that length being too much at times because sometimes it's a little harder for those goalies to move around the ice but coast is really good at moving around his crazy he's efficient in his movements and um i've said it a few times where i think he's the best goaltender outside of the big three in the last three years and in the big threes obviously knight oscar oven in walstadt but i think coast is the best one outside of those three in the last three years so i'd push for him here personally um he's gonna i mean he's looked great in in whl in his first game basically so um hopefully we continue seeing that and edmonton's just so head and shoulders above every other team that that alberta division it's going to be tough to really get a gauge on him but there's still skill players out there that are going to test them so i think cosa goes in at 36 here um unless anyone else has any objection to that all right now someone would putting salmon and next be all that crazy too like no think i people are really high on him so i guess not but i yeah i just don't like him that much but i think he's a good player and i don't think that's too high all right so let's put him at 36. he definitely needs to be higher than harrison in my opinion at least i mean at least what i saw from harrison in finland he wasn't really impressive to be honest yeah harrison's a guy that i'm going to be curious as to where we settle on him at um so let's talk have the course in coolman's conversation because that's going to happen and i know dylan doesn't want to have it um i'd have him closer to 50 personally he's he's skilled he can make good passes offensively but like i don't know what he's doing 95 of the time when he's on the ice and i i think there's a base to work with there and that's that's something i always try to look at is is if an nhl team gets their hands on this kid and can build off that base what can they do and with coolman's there's a player there but i just don't know what it is i know nick you're a little bit higher on him and a few others might be as well so maybe we talk about him a little bit i think it's to your point the base right like the the toolkit to work with there while he might be a bit more of a long-term project who needs a lot of refinement in his game really needs to work on his decision-making i just think like the raw skill and skating ability and just willingness to to engage physically and try to impact the game i i think that it's something that's valuable in this range he's just another one of those guys that you really got to trust your development staff i i there's really not much more to say about him other than that so if we're going to have the the coleman's conversation i feel like we should bring up evan now and vince and i oreo so uh brayden talk about evan daus a little bit because i know you and i are both big fans of him yeah i like evan now it's quite a lot he uh he uh he's he's consistent he doesn't do a whole lot wrong um every once in a while you'll see him make a uh wonky pass uh out of the defensive zone like he almost blacks out for half a second but i mean that that is that is really looking hard for um things to find as flaws in his game i think for the most part he's very consistent through transition he uh he holds the blue line well he pinches well um he can quarterback a power play really well um across the board i think he's he's got a little bit upside i know we don't see a whole lot of production out of him um or maybe as much as um as much as you see out other offensive defensemen in junior but but every time i watch him and this is something that you and i have talked about before do you you think that he should be um you know accruing more points than he is um because he he does get involved in the offense he can be he can be really creative and elusive with the puck he protects the puck well in transition so um across the board i think he's uh i think he's got a lot going for him and very minor things to correct um that are very few and far between so as far as as far as a player with um who's who i think is a really safe bet um evan evan mouse definitely fits the bill for sure i think he's a good case study like talking about coolman's just prior to to him just because the refinement in naos game and like how he keeps things simple just kind of plays a little more steady whereas coolermen's is you're really just kind of projecting the skill set and hoping that you can reign in the decision making and things like that i think now's a pretty safe bet in this range yeah if that if that's if that's the question of coleman's like um like i i to be completely honest i haven't watched coleman's at all but uh with with mouse i really don't have a whole lot of question marks um let me say the biggest the biggest flaw that i find sometimes is that it seems like once or twice a game it'll just kind of um throw a pass into traffic and uh i think that's something that can be corrected i think you can you know make a guy aware that you're concerned about his decision-making in the defensive zone um periodically but um if he if he puts a little bit of focus on you know eliminating that aspect of his game i think uh i think he's a really good option to be um a second pair uh defenseman at some point in his career and i think vincent ayorio falls into that same uh category as evan now so whereas he's so ref like i don't want to say refined but he's still composed with the puck he's so he just understands what what he needs to do next um he's always thinking one step ahead and he always kind of has a plan for what he's gonna do with the puck even in those like quick uh quick decision moments where he's uh going back to uh retrieve a dump in or something like that with a forechecker right on him he just understands where to put the puck next um and to me that's what separates those two guys from a guy like carson of course in coleman's um because they they do have that that level of puck skill that he also has but they don't feel the need to pull it out all the time and and with course and coolman's i almost feel like he tries too hard as much as that sounds with the on the stick um he always wants to make that huge play he always wants to make that play that that looks great and um it doesn't always work out and the tools are there and the base is there um dylan i know you have concerns about course colemans as well as i do so uh maybe kind of state your case uh on that regard well i mean first of all he's playing in the ajhl which immediately makes me not want to not rank him at all um i don't know i'm just whenever i watch him i'm just not blown away by anything in particular um defensively it's always worrying everyone that i've talked to about him is like yeah he'd be really good if your team is playing positionless hockey and you can just kind of let him do whatever he wants um there's just not a lot of control to his game uh i'm just never like seeing a first round guy when i'm watching him it's always you know maybe this guy makes the nhl maybe he just you know flounders out you know can't get his defensive game to a level that's going to be able to compete with nhler's um but i mean if he can reach that upside he's obviously pretty solid offensively um it's just i'm just never really uh convinced by him to be that guy all right so i my big thing is i look at him and i look at a guy like brent johnson and i go which one am i willing to take the bet on um and so well let's start with this i think iorio and even evan aus are probably the next two names on this list at this point um i think we've all kind of talked about how they both project well they will have uh a lot of composure to their game and and you you can see them being an nhl defender so i think 38 and 39 those two guys should fit in there um once we get into the 40s that's where i'm more willing to entertain course and coolman's um i think yeah i was gonna say i think mackie samus comes into the conversation here as well um this is where for liam though nielsen as well yeah i was just gonna say the interior to tell us why william strong shouldn't be here we'll get to that later don't you i'm not gonna make it i'm not gonna make him yell at me yet um so so let's go let's go with uh yeah the swedes are always nice people he's never gonna yell at me he just sends me mean dms whatever i'm just going to ignore that but uh so evan nelson vincennario are 38 39. um sasuko job i think probably fits into this range as well i know like i said claire is really high on them i've seen the flashes that make people high on him so uh putting him at 40 is not that bad of an idea um now we get into um like i said liam darren nielsen um jeremy wilmers may be in this conversation a bit later too but brent johnson versus corson coolman's that's the one i'm kind of curious about the group's think on that um aj i know you've seen brent johnson quite a bit so what's your take on his game and i know you've seen coolman's a bit so what do you kind of think between those two i have tony i didn't know that i could have swore you were one of those guys that were high oh never mind then no just me being an idiot look at that i haven't i've barely watched 50 games man you hired me like last week i swear i thought you were you had said you'd seen him so all right games in one week is pretty good aj so uh yeah i'm pretty proud but i have no day job so that's part of it to get it back on the rails a little bit i know i i'm probably the highest on coulombs at anyone here so i am totally fine if you guys want to still push them down the list a little ways don't feel like you have to squeeze them in here well like i think the range i had in there was 30 to 50 and that's the range that was also put in there afterwards as well so i don't think that's a we're in a bad spot 41 is kind of right in the middle of that um i think putting him in there um is fine if anyone wants to put brent johnson ahead with me i'm fine with doing that as well but otherwise i think cool man's at 41 is fine i uh i got some some games in on brent johnson after uh will was hyping him up in the discord and so i saw a couple games and like i think like there's not much between him and coolman's but i think that i'm pretty confidently putting him ahead of kuhlman's uh just you know he's just been great this year in the ushl probably the best of one of the best defensemen in the league like the entire league all right so let's do 41 brent johnson because i got my way and a dictator and this is how things work and then 42. thank you i just need one voice to be like yeah right so now let's get into liam dowd nelson because he's a guy i really like in this range as well um it's a little bit of a high pick for him in terms of like the public sector and in what i've seen in terms of his ranking but i think he's more than willing to be in this right in his range so uh mikhail talk about him a bit well i see quite quite the potential upside for him as well that he could because he's such a smart player like he's always it feels like he's always in the correct position he's reading plays defensively he's he's using his hands aren't like the most gifted but he like uses them to create some space for himself and get out of tough spots he he's amazing on the power play like he he can dictate the power play from behind the net and he's just like you can control it from users to behind that's like a point like a point like playing the points so i i i really enjoy him and i think like he could have some like if he reaches his top top top potential he could be a second line center for sure i see him like uh like a victor asked before he uh before he turned bad or something like that like someone saw him like current battery it's a better turned into a pumpkin uh yeah exactly but i think he something something like a victor type of player i see in liam donaison i guess he could be a 50 point senator for sure in the in the show i feel like yeah i agree with you i i think he's got enough skill to make his game work and i i think he's he's good enough in every area i think right he's one of those guys that you don't look at and you're like here's the one major flaw that is going to be detrimental to him making it to the next level like even his flaws aren't to the point where you look at him and go like he's not going to make it or something right so um unless anyone has any objection i'm more than willing to put him at 43. um i think that's where brent johnson or brent harris brett harrison conversation maybe starts um caitlyn i know you've seen him a bit so uh what's your take on on brett harrison's game yeah um he he's not the most sort of he's not the guy who's gonna wow you but he's very hard-working he's kind of that two-way center type um he's not really the one to drive the play but he he he can sort of apply himself and and compete in all zones um i'm i think i'm lower on brett harrison than a lot of other people just because i just haven't seen a ton from him and and especially especially recently but yeah he's he's one of those steady guys he's responsible he can he can make the right pass make the right play when he needs to um but yeah i'm not super high on him but i take him kind of in this range yeah i know i've talked to jacob a few times about brett harrison and we always come to the conclusion like if he's just on your line facilitating as either a left wing or as a center and he's able to kind of get into his spots to use his shot i i think that's more than a good spot for him i think i think he's a great he's got a good shot he's not gonna be the guy that's burning up and down the ice he plays a methodical game and um i i i like him but yeah it's not like i'm he's a guy that i'm banging the table for um i don't think really at any point unless you he starts falling really bad but um i know jacob's a fan of him too and he has him kind of in this range so um unless there's any objections to his game here i know e2 you've seen him a little bit too so uh what's your take there um i think this is a good range as i said i i wasn't too impressed but um i i liked that he he was a really good play maker when he played in finland but he's his skating was wasn't too good i think it was even worse than solomon s yeah his skating is definitely an issue and i think that's kind of what holds him back from taking that step to being like a legitimately dangerous player on every shift um but he he's smart he's he makes good pat like he makes the play to the right spot and everything so um damn it brayden um uh but yeah brett harrison's a guy that i think in this range isn't uh isn't a reach by any means because i think he could be a a good solid third line center that plays at both ends of the ice yeah and um i actually the games i saw i heard were not that good games from him i i heard that he played better games when he like got the new finnish finnish style and the bigger ring and stuff and then he was i heard that he was really good in some games also i think this is a good range we shouldn't drop him more all right so i'm happy putting him here this entire carrot juice coffee situation is crazy um my adhd is kicking in i don't think there's another like q player for like 30 picks roughly so i know i've got a couple i'll bring up for you brayden you can tell me why i have them but uh one player i think we need to have a conversation about is matthew samuskevich um this guy i've seen as high as like 13 or 14 on some rankings and i think those people are lunatics who are just flying by the seat of the pants and and have my mindset of draft the skill and upside in literally don't care about anything else with him um but he's got the skill he's got the shot um i've talked to ryan hardy a couple times and he's always the guy that he that he's pushing from the steel um so i i there's a lot of gms a lot of coaches that seem to see a lot in this kid um the skill is there he just he's small he doesn't do a whole lot off the puck and and you worry about that but when he's got the puck on his stick he's one of the most giftable players in the draft he's one of the most like you see the highlights and you're like man like this why isn't this guy a first-round pick and then you watch the game and you go okay well there's the defensive issues and stuff so um at 45 i think that's a fine range for him uh like i said i know claire is a lot higher on him as well and uh she thinks he's a guy that could kind of be that third guy in a wing on the wing and be the guy that just contributes offensively for a line and i don't disagree with that factor at all like if that's the situation and get himself in i think he'd be perfectly productive so unless anyone's opposed to it i think him at 45 wouldn't be a bad idea um jack o'brien is a guy that looked way better in the whl last year than than what he does now now he's not looking the best but um it's gonna yeah it's gonna be interesting to see what exactly he turns into at the next level with jack o'brien because um when he was playing with with seth jarvis last year he looked great like there's no doubt about that but he was playing with seth jarvis and that's a big factor like seth jarvis is making the ahl look like a joke so um i'm not sure where i'd put jack o'brien but matthew samus i think is a guy that kind of fits in at 45 unless anyone has any uh objection to that all right who is next on the list for somebody someone thrown a name for a guy that they'd like to get uh some love to uh arjun kruznikov ah why he hasn't played it all this year but you know i don't want to drop too far because of that um ohl sucks true stupid canada you guys can get anything right so i just before we go any further i just want to make sure that everyone is aware for anybody that ends up listening to this that our mhl guy has insulted the ajhl which is fair i totally agree with that one but and now the ohl as well and i'm sure he's going to do the whl as well at some point so go ahead w sucks there we go all right dylan what's uh what's your your take on uh he's just rock solid defensively um doesn't really like stand out with like high-end plays just a lot of reliability with him uh obviously hasn't been able to play it all this year would have liked to see him come back to russia um definitely could have been playing maybe even khl minutes at this point um but he just like there's some things that he needs to work on he's passing out of the defensive zone um leaves to leave stuff to be desired um but he's physical he's uh really solid defensively he'll throw the body he'll get uh picky with a stick he'll jump in on plays uh as for his upside i don't think that he's like gonna blow out anything out of the water so i mean if there's more like boomer bus picks maybe you take them ahead of him but if you're looking for somebody who's gonna really be solid on your bottom pairing maybe even push for that second pairing uh he's your guy now mikhail there's a guy that kind of fits a similar profile in sweden in anton olsen so so give me your take on his game um uh anthony is a mainly defensive defenseman who i watch lately and doesn't do anything for me anymore when i see him in the shl he doesn't produce any offense he throws the puck to ice saying he like i watched two the latest two games i think he was and he he was in like his when he was on the ice he was in the off like his team was in the offensive zone twice maybe in two games so he's i don't see any ups like he any upside with him and i don't think his defense have been has been as good as we thought it was earlier as well so i think he can slip for 25 picks more or something yeah i agree well he's a guy who like the more i watch him he keeps just kind of bumping further down my list every time i watch him play it's just there's not a lot there i don't think he's probably he's a smart player i think he understands how to defend he's maybe still just a little over matched at the shl level uh but there's not much offense there and he's not going to be driving play from the back end or anything like that yeah when i look at my notes on him like from you know october november and then from more recently it's like nothing has changed i have the same exact comments about his game he hasn't really grown at all i don't think and i think that's caused him to fall a bit more for me too i agree with mikael on the range for that i think he's a good third round target but i think defensively one thing i have a problem with is that he shies away from using his body at all you're always seeing him like flailing his stick out a lot more and he gets beat because of that sometimes and i think that i don't know if that's somewhat just a positioning issue or something that he can work on with a coach or if there's some laziness involved in that but i think that uh he really hasn't done it for me either yeah and if you're talking about olson as well i'd like you and eastern even better than than wilson right now but you'll need to make an over age as well as you have to take that into account so all right so dylan i'm cool with putting grishnikov next and kind of getting in there but the one question i have is is where do we put aiden horace because sometimes he's really good and other times he's really bad and and he was a guy that i thought coming into the year was going to be a lot better than he is so um anyone have any idea like any comment on his game maybe dylan like would you take him over gryshnikov or would you still lean grishnikov there the issue is uh harashaka is like he's progressed backwards this year i feel like uh towards the start of the year he was like i was pushing top 15 even not that long ago i was trying to like i had him in a group for my top 15 and i watched more of him and i was like okay he was pretty solid start of the year and now he's just kind of there he's not uh doing a lot anymore uh defensively he's still you know one of the better defensive players on that team but uh i just he's he's so weird because of how much he's fallen off in uh such a short span of time that it's hard to rank him especially since he's not like one of the younger players like if he was like jeremy wilmer's age i'd be like okay he'll probably end up bouncing back but he's you know a february birthday uh i'm just he's very confusing i i'm not really sure where i would put him right now at all am i crazy to have sean barrons ahead of press jack at this point i think i think crash chuck's more likely to be an nhl player i don't really see barons being i i don't want to say i don't see him being an nhl player but i don't see i see him having a lot more hurdles to jump over to get there i think hashtags can have a lot easier time becoming uh that kind of like number six guy maybe we're just gonna hold the fort defensively and then maybe chip in offensively barons is just i think the size with barons is probably gonna be something that holds him back but but i i really like the way he plays the game i think he's like decisive when he's got the puck on his stick he likes to attack and i think he's pretty smart defensively as well but but the size is probably what's gonna hold him back yeah i think with barons like the thing with him is like he when he has the puck on the stick especially in the offensive zone he can do some things like some some real high-end stuff and you look at him and you go okay like there's there's a first-round pick here um my concern comes when when he's playing defensively on the rush or even especially when he's like trying to defend sustained zone pressure he just he seems so lost and it's not just a strength thing with him or a size thing with him and just in the defensive zone he just doesn't seem to know exactly what to do and when he get like i said when he gets that loose puck and he's able to get it on his stick it's a different game with him so um the upside's there for sure like if someone were to try to push for barons in this range i know claire has him uh rigged in this range uh so it's not crazy to think he'd be here um but him and harass truck are both kind of guys i put closer together than a lot of people at the start of the year and and i mean i guess people had them close at the start of the year they were just both first rounders at the start of the year and now they're not so um it's gonna be an interesting one i had a ryan of code to this conversation as well because i noticed there's some uh divisiveness between his ranges here uh he's another small defensive in the ushl and i mean i think he's uh ahead of barons personally but claire really likes efco too yeah claire likes him a lot she was hyping him up so i went and watched him more uh he's better defensively than barons he's uh they're kind of at the same level offensively they kind of do different things in the zone uh upco's just kind of a really smart player he moves the puck more efficiently he's great on the power play but i mean it's a chicago steel power play so i mean it's pretty easy to look good on that yeah i want to throw another chicago steel defender in here i know another guy i'm probably higher on than most but i really like jack bear like the the tools that he's got i think he he's like he's really elusive for a guy his size he's able to kind of skate the puck out of trouble in the defensive zone i think he protects it well on retrievals and just kind of moving it to the available outlet he kind of senses pressure well but he also kind of maybe takes too many risks he really likes to jump up into the rush and he does have the ability to recover but i think he's got to kind of manage that risk reward a little bit better uh he's a guy that probably needs to work on his his mobility when it comes to like pivoting defending the rush and stuff like that but i think he keeps a tight gap he's good at sort of directing guys where he wants to go but if they get that kind of outside step on him he has trouble from that point but he he's another guy he's like unlike barons and ufco he's got the size to kind of compete at the next level he's another guy i have in this range just personally all right so before we start assigning rankings to some of these defensemen i want to get uh itsu in here to talk about billy coivanon this guy has been a fun fun player sami helenius is another guy in this range uh pick one of those to e2 and who you think goes higher and give give your take on why he should be here um i don't think i neither of those guys are in this range actually um e2 hates spins yeah he's just taking over yoki's role my region but um helenius is really good as it's crazy that he's a 18 year old guy playing liga and his physicality against men is really good and he's a elite penalty killer and the guy is yeah he's a good player but he doesn't really have that ceiling that upside he doesn't have that much offensive skill so i don't think he will go that high maybe early third is good for him and or late second and uh for covenant i don't think that he he would be this high so maybe maybe neither in this range but maybe after maybe somewhere around 55 we can take them into the discussion all right i'd like to throw in uh victor khan bore yourself in this area around this range yeah state your casey or miguel well he's he he's very smart like he found find space almost everywhere like openers that opens it up like gates into space try to relieve his defensemen when they need like need to find a past and he's got some nice play-making skills as well but he's a hard worker he's a great force checker and he's very solid defensively he also plays like regularly on in which is in in the shell which is the i think third number one in the league if they're not then they're number two so i think he he needs to be considered on this range because he i think i like him a lot and i think he's going to get better with the more opportunity he gets as well yeah i don't i don't disagree with you there at all he's a guy that i've really liked when i've seen him so uh how are we feeling about this uh after krishnakava is 46 47 ryanofco 48 jack o'brien get him in there because like i said there's a lot there to like but he didn't kind of run the coattails of seth jarvis a little bit last year but he's still doing some good things in the ushl then victor sternberg uh jack o'brien or jack barr sorry at 50. uh aiden rush truck at 51. um anyone opposed to any of those those guys at those spots all right now this is where i make my case for jeremy wilmer the small tiny little guy from the us national team and i i feel like every time i make my case i have to classify that he's a small small guy but this guy just makes the right play so often he's just always doing um the small thing right whether it's it's he's getting along the board he's chipping the pass to the middle or he's fighting around the net he does a lot of things well and his size really doesn't play as much a factor as a lot of guys his size like i see him framing up in the in the corners and stuff and using his body position to really excel so um jeremy wilmer is a guy that i had at 51 on my rankings 52 here i wouldn't be opposed to um but there's guys like shawn barons who i'm willing to talk about as well here um and then we can kind of get into some of the other guys too so um i think maybe we go bearings at 52 in wilmer at 53. if everyone's okay with that i'd flip-flop them personally but that was my first in inclination as well as flip-flopping them and then putting barons at 53 and wilmer at 52. um anyone opposed to that that's almost exactly what i have on my list here so okay perfect all right and now now maybe do we get to that anton olsen range i i still think he probably goes down further um no put him in the third round yeah all right so now we get to um some more guys that are a little bit more uh divisive at least and this is where we can kind of get into the typhoid conversation i think he probably goes a little further though i think yeah i think this this could be a good range for helena news yeah yeah because while he doesn't have that much upside and he's not going to be probably not going to be a point scorer in the nhl i think his certainty is very good i think he yeah yeah because the physicality the frame and he's still a pretty good really good skater even though he's a big guy so i think he he's gonna be bottom six in a show player but i'm not top six yeah the floor alone i think makes him worthy of this range yeah exactly yeah he's such a good defensive player i think he really does warrant being in this conversation because he's smart he in when whenever he gets that offensive chance around the net he he dub d's and hands around the net and he can kind of convert once in a while there so i'm not opposed to him being there um dylan you have the next russian guy highlighted so uh give your case on him because he was a guy that i hadn't watched a whole lot until i seen that you you where you had him uh ranged at and i was like okay i gotta watch a couple games of this guy i really liked what i saw yeah dimitri karlevsky he's been playing in the vhl basically all year he has some sporadic mhl khl games um playing a lot with alexander kovanov on his wing um just another really good defensive forward coming out of russia which is not normal they usually just don't play defense at all but he's uh constantly moving around the ice he moves so well um very fluid uh uh apply pressure close down space gets the puck and then uh there's some issues when he has the puck uh especially outside the offensive zone just with his decision-making uh he struggles to make that first pass sometimes or if he should pass or she he should skate up the ice um that's just you know a small thing that's going to come with time uh he's obviously an 18 year old playing in a men's league it's not always easy for them to make the simple plays they're a place that looks simple um offensively i was kind of worried at the beginning of the year i watched him in the nhl and i thought okay he's kind of just playing as a defenseman once the puck is kind of in an area where they're about to lose it he'll immediately be sitting back further than his two defensemen but as the season has progressed he's developed well offensively he set the scoring record uh u18 the vhl most points in the season um he's just someone who's been rising for me he's not really a name that you see often but i mean what he's been doing in the vhl this year has been very good yeah he was a guy that like like i said i hadn't watched a ton of them up until i'd seen where you got him ranked and stuff and then when i i watched three games uh since you you you put him in that range and i was like okay like i want to get at least a decent read on this guy and yeah like i i'd have no opposition to putting him in this like 50 to 50 50 to 60 range because like like you said he's not a guy that gets a ton of love the vhl itself doesn't get a ton of love either so um i'd be comfortable putting him at 55 or 56 because like he does enough well that you can project him to the nhl level in him being at least a capable player so um unless anyone has any objections i know probably no one else has seen him so um there's probably not a whole lot there but um i'd be more than willing to put him here at 56 and then maybe we get to a guy like uh ty voigt um maybe this is where we can kind of start to talk about a guy like uh or philly covenant or uh nolan allen's another guy out west that'd be a good spot here um unless we want to get into the goalies or or matthew knees who's to me a guy but a lot of people like what they see with his skill has anybody kept up on jj moser i have he's okay like he he can score and stuff like my opinion on him is is sign him to an ahl deal don't draft him just sign him to an hl deal because he's almost at the age where you can and stuff so um i'm more than willing to bring him over i just don't know if i waste a draft pick on him right um and i mean waste is a harsh word but uh if i use a traffic on him because i you look at a guy like even like alexa him will sell me who we'll get into in a few minutes in a minute or two um but i take him for sure even though like most draft boards don't even know who that guy is so uh i think it's uh just drafting double overages this high yes kind of like super out of the question for me yeah um especially when it's somebody that you can sign so quickly and bring them over so quickly if it's maybe if he's like playing in the khl or something then there's some more value to it because you can kind of let him stay there a few more years you just have his rights forever but i mean playing in the swiss league you can just sign him i'm not using a pick on him yeah um the thing i i think was if you are a bad team that nobody wants to play for and there is a player who has yeah little teams after like free agency uh maybe then you want to trust him because you know that if there's other three teams trying to get him as a free agent you don't get it maybe then but yeah i see you your point yeah taking them in the seventh round is a swing that you're kind of willing to take but uh this high even in the top 100 i probably hesitate from it um but let's get into this next group here because there's there's a few guys that um they're kind of all over on rankings and stuff so um let's bring up wyatt johnson real quick and uh caitlyn maybe talk about him i i i saw him all the time last year he's plays in windsor so i'll talk about maybe after you okay um so i like quiet johnson to a point he's so smart passing good use of his body he seems like a pretty strong kid although he's only lifted uh listens 167 pounds right now um he's good at finding that open space he has a good shot uh kind of gets to the net a lot i think he's considered more of a two-way and i see that i didn't see a lot of there was nothing i saw from him that really made me super excited he's a very smart player he kind of knows where to be uh he's another one of those sort of capable two-way guys um decent top speed not amazing speed um but yeah i i can see him i i think i had him down as 50 to 70 so i can see him dropping a tiny bit more and i know there are some people who aren't quite as high on him but i i i wouldn't mind if he was in this range yeah my thing with him is like i i i i completely agree with everything you said there caitlyn and and the one thing that kind of makes me go okay maybe like there is something more here is the fact that last year when he was playing with uh john luke footy and uh will cooley that was the best those two looked all year long um like those two struggled at times last year and and i foodie was a guy that i saw a lot from and and thought he should have went higher but um wyatt johnson really kind of tied that line those two together and they i mean the season ended up getting cut short and uh they only played about five to seven games together but when they did like those two looked back like the first round picks everyone thought they were at the start of the year so um i'm curious to see where he ends up going uh he's one of those guys that i'm just excited to see when he gets back on the ice so um i i put him in this range i have nothing against that um carol kersenov is maybe a guy i put ahead of him so uh dylan maybe talk about uh your favorite defenseman uh yeah favorite um he's just so weird um he's almost like a blank canvas with who has just some of the pieces there and you can kind of mold him um he's a really good skater through the neutral zone uh he pivots well um uses crossovers really well to build up speed and he gets into the offensive zone and then he just has the puck and he doesn't know what to do with it and he just loses it and it's like well you probably could have done something better there maybe you know calm down a little bit uh defensively uh he's you know a work in progress but he's playing in the khl uh plays played in the vhl played the world juniors played everywhere um looked really solid with team russia at the buyer hockey games playing against men there it's just what is he gonna do in the two zones that matter the most rather than just in the neutral zone as a puck moving defenseman so like i i agree with what you're saying there and like he was the guy that i feel like people got a lot of hype for at the world juniors and they seem to like him there um yeah he's a guy that i put in this range um at 57 i probably have him like and i think that's a fair spot unless you disagree there dylan uh no i think that's fine um so 57 for him 58 at wyatt johnson and i slipped matthew knees in there at at 59 because i i know claire's super high in him he's got a ton of skill he reminds me a lot of matthew samuskevich but like the b-plus version of matthew samuskevich so um him being 20 10 spots 15 spots lower than semester which kind of fits for me um now we get to arrange that there's a lot of guys that we just kind of like i say this every 10 picks i feel like but we get to a range where they're it's it's super wide open again like we have guys like william stromgrind kind of in here um i know we're going to push him back a little bit um oliver kaepernick ty voigt uh billy coyvan are guys that i think we should probably talk about here um anton olsen maybe fits here um uh mikhail you think anton gets in here or alexa not quite yet but i guess since it is pretty wide open if people if there's anyone else who's watched him if michael wants to weigh in two on this i mean i think this is the earliest you could see him get picked it's not where i would pick him don't wait until the third round at least with them i think yeah it's awesome all right so let's talk about ty voigt the tiny little fella plays for starting to sting um he's a bit of a buzzsaw um he's got a decent shot he gets the the dirty areas but he gets pushed around all the time so um there's a lot of people that love this kid and the i think the processing of his game is is no issue like that's not that's not the problem um the skills aren't the issue that's not a problem he's a good he's a good not great skater um the the biggest red flag with him is the fact that he's little and i am always the guy that's like pumping guys for like hey it's okay if you're little like you can get by it but for whatever reason i can't get by it with high voigt so putting him at 60 kind of feels like a decent spot um i'd be willing to push him back more though if if others had that feeling so uh caitlyn based on some of the other ohl guys that are available right now you think he goes or is there someone else you'd like to get in there um i since taiwan was kind of high on my list i actually had a lot of why johnson i i wouldn't mind him going now um i i just think his he's such an offensive threat when he gets going um i think one of the things that's an issue with him as well as his size is that skating maybe if his skating was uh just a little bit quicker a little bit better it would sort of mitigate a lot of those times he gets pushed off the puck but the thing about him is his feet are always moving anyway and he does have that work ethic and he does have that kind of drive to go and do things um so i i think there's there's a ton of of offensive upside on this guy but it just depends how how many people are comfortable drafting a tiny little guy this high up yeah i think when i look at this and i look the guys are around him the the one guy that i go and i'm like man i i'd probably take him for sure above typhoid is billy coyvan and i know i'm a little bit higher than than even e2 is on him but i think we could probably slip him in here um maybe talk about dimitri costenco benjamin gujo or tristan lennox if we want to start getting into goalies again um it really depends so anyone have any specific guy they'd like to maybe shoe in there at 60 i like goudreau a lot yeah gujo's fun like i mean the thing that sticks out with me for goudreau is um his gaming he played against windsor one time last year and he had 54 saves and led in two goals and it was just this game where like windsor was just absolutely hammering him in and the way he was just able to stay composed make the saves move on to the next save and just do what he does and that like it was really encouraging he's um he's got a ton of talent um if i'm not mistaken he's yeah he's got good size for a goalie um he needs to fill this frame but every kid at this age does so um and he played on a bad team i think that doesn't get he doesn't get credit for the fact that he did play on such a terrible team like sarnia was rough last year and and he really was like the only reason they won on a couple of occasions so um i'd be fine kind of getting benjamin goudreau in there i think tristan lennox is probably going to be right in after him i like the idea of having those two together because um lennox does have a lot of upside and when lennox is at his best i do think he's better but i think benjamin goudreau is just consistently better so if we put benjamin goudre at 60 tossing linux at 61 seems about fair and then maybe we get into billy koivenin e2 would you uh be opposed to that around 62. no i think it's fine um i think second round is a bit high for him but it's barely second round so so i'm gonna ask you this then e2 him or alexi hamill selmy you can't ask that maybe maybe koi wouldn't okay because the thing is that he's really like raw and he's not the best skater or the most dynamic player but he's he's really smart and i really like how he he creates chances and it's it's really efficient and sometimes when you're watching garapata and you're you're wanting to see duham allah do great things and then the koivenant that just steals the show and the walmart is like a complimentary player of those two and uh that um so yeah i think that's a good price for him yeah i think like you said though there's so many times where i've been wanting to watch to amala and i noticed koivan and so i i think he deserves to kind of get into this range um the other guy i wanted to mention here is nolan allen uh plays out in whl he doesn't get a ton of love but i think he's one of those perfect examples of the guy that hasn't played yet and just getting pushed on boards um i know joel was huge on him um i i've watched a few of his games recently from last year just to kind of refresh myself and he reminds me of like just a guy that doesn't make a bad play like consistently um he he's of course he makes a bad pass once in a while but he's always on the right side of the puck he makes uh he makes up for it with his ability to kind of skate and get into the position so i think nolan allen's a guy that um he's not getting the love because he's not playing and once they kind of get playing out there in the whl and get 10 games under their belt people will start to notice them so um i'm going to throw him at 63 unless anyone has any objections to that i know the whole guys are really hard to rank this year because just like the ohl like they haven't played and for the whl guys they haven't really gone elsewhere to play for the most part so um outside of the ushl but nolan allen's a guy that he's a little bit young on on for the draft class if i'm not mistaken yeah he's eight end of april birthday it's almost a may birthday so um 63 seems about right for him and then that's where we start to get into the connor lockhart's uh red savage uh oliver kaepernick's in this range as well i would push for james malatesta in this range too i just think the speed is such a weapon the way that he's able to kind of just blow by defenders and he can separate quickly perhaps again i'm higher on him than most i don't know where braden's probably seen him play more than i have i don't know where you've got him at braden but i just think that the he's got like that water bug element to his game too he's quick and shifty he needs to kind of tighten up the the decisions where he just kind of fires pucks blindly sometimes but but i like the the tool kit there for for me with mel testa it's all about the speed yeah i i could be convinced probably nick um i think my concern with malatesta like like you say his speed is second to very very few probably in the league or in the class in the league um i find he's more of a straight line type of player like he can he he uses his speed up the boards and then um i find he's very reactive with the puck he's um rather than a guy who's thinking ahead of the play yeah i feel like he he uh yeah when he's forced forced to um i don't know maybe that's not the right way to put it but like uh under pressure he almost kind of panics sometimes and he just decides he's gonna fire the puck somewhere before he takes that look or has that mental snapshot of the layout of the zone and where his teammates are at yeah he definitely needs to improve that part of his game but that that being said well and at this point in the draft i guess if there's you know there's depending on what else is out there that what malatesta also does offer is is a pretty significant physical uh component to his game you know yeah even for a small guy yeah yeah i mean have you ever seen what he looks like without equipment on he he's stocky he's jacked yeah yeah yeah so i i think um yeah if you if you want a guy who you could hedge your bets with too again we were talking about someone earlier um with kind of the same same kind of security blanket so to speak he's a guy who yeah i i don't know if you'd ever see him projecting into a top six but uh i think he could be a good energy player yes absolutely good for checker um and and you know considering his size he uh he does does quite well in that type of a role um so like i i don't hate that idea yeah now one of the more interesting uh ranges that i saw on this list when i was going through them was from you at braden and it was isaac beliveau yeah he's been up and down and and for one point he was a first round pick at now there's a lot of people who don't rank him in the top 100 and you had him in the 60 to 75 range so yeah that's right about the range we're in right now so let's talk about him too yeah so i i don't know if it's a coincidence but the two guys who played with la fenier last year and thrived have been absolute roller coasters this year balduk and belleville but so since beliveau has moved over to gatineau um i find that he simplified his game quite a lot um he seemed very scatterbrained i don't know if it was a factor of not having a guy like laferniere to rely on to really um you know complete the plays in rimouski but um now in in gatineau i find that he's uh i guess they simplified his game he still has the strengths in terms of his his skating and his and his puck control he's a he's a pretty strong um player in terms of his ability to uh not react he uh or or react i guess he when he when he is put under pressure he's able to uh slither out pretty uh pretty well so i like him in this range i don't know nick have you have you watched bellaville at all uh just kind of in passing uh he's not a player i've really dialed in on a lot but the the one thing that the one negative with belivo that kind of stands out to me is i find his feet can be kind of heavy at times uh he's he's not all the time like you said he can be slippery on occasion but sometimes he's a little slow getting going from what i've seen i find when he has to pivot that's where he kind of falls apart a little bit you know in a defensive transition when yeah when he's forced to edge a guy out i find he he does lose a step on on guys pushing him to the outside his another thing is his decision making is not always the quickest but i find he has the mobility in his feet to buy some time so he can make a good pass up ice but coming back towards the defensive zone he does struggle a little bit i've seen a couple instances even in the games that i do really like him more recently i've seen a couple instances where still either he pivots and completely loses a stride on the attacker or he doesn't pivot and he he loses them he just kind of lets him you know go around to the outside so defensively i don't even know if um i would rely on him being able to improve that i i would kind of look at him in the light of a player who who that's that's what he is um and and judge him based on that for now at least i don't know if i would say well you know maybe he can improve that so we draft him you know based on his upside it is concerning for sure on on the defensive side of the puck but uh kind of reminds me of william villeneuve a little bit from last year yeah yeah either either villeneuve or poirier one one of the other that's kind of what i thought of last night actually too so um he's he does play more that style than uh than anybody else as far as defenseman though so you think he gets in this range then then uh guys he's a little bit lower for me i i'm not going to speak for braden but yeah no no i i like it like you say tony i bumped him up bumping down more recently bumped them up but um yeah you know what i'm i'm comfortable waiting maybe another 10 10 picks roughly we're at 63. like i i like his upside that being said um like like i mentioned i don't think you bank on him making significant improvements in the areas where he is flawed right now i don't think you can really take that risk i think it's a pretty uh yeah i think it's pretty significant yes i guess so um there are a few other guys i kind of have um around here from the queue i don't know um justin robot does it a guy that we've been up and down i'm not as high on him as a lot of other people probably um joshua i know we've talked about him in in the uh in the slack chat a little bit where are you out on cam why not brayden um i i haven't watched cam why not in probably a month um and more recently i came down on them but but i haven't like i said i haven't watched them kind of even even since nova scotia's returned here so maybe he's doing a little bit different than what i saw more recently so why not the player i really like i think he does good to kind of tighten up the gap in the neutral zone and sort of smother breakouts before they get going it's kind of rangy skates well for his size he's someone that i'd considered as a second round player and then and then some something along the line turned me off um i think i i think i felt like i saw inconsistent effort in some of his games but that's a guy i wouldn't fight you on at all actually right now is cam weiner so i'm more willing to get cam why not in here um but there is a couple of defensemen i want to try to get maybe ahead of them um and the first one is dmitry costanko and and he was a guy that um i've just really liked watching in general i'm gonna be completely honest uh dylan uh talk about him a little bit oh yeah he does a lot right he's a good pokemon defenseman um i've been watching him in his mhl games recently and i've been really disappointed with it um he's been a lot better in the vhl in the mhl which is weird it almost feels like at times uh he's just in a system as a pokemon defenseman playing on a team that says hey don't do that don't move the puck we want to play defense at all times we want to suck so when he tries to make these passes his teammates just don't know what to do because he's obviously a step ahead of them in the vhl and the mhl even uh vhl level as i discussed with uh svetchkov nobody wants to play hockey on that team uh so he's taking a lot of shots he's trying a lot of passes which uh with a normal player like on a fine team i'm not happy with the defenseman's shooting a lot but you know someone has to take the shots on that team and he has a really weird shot he when he does snapchat the his stick is like all the way above his head and then some um but he gets a lot of power behind it it's a pretty good shot uh on the power play he fakes it a lot and it always works because who's going to fake a shot like that and so it fools everybody and then he you know he's controls the and passes it so i was like a power play guy uh definitely a lot of value there um probably a really protectable um you know second pairing third pairing guy in the nhl just needs to develop and again totally out he's not a good team to develop on so there's always that question there maybe he gets traded maybe you have to sign him early but you know you kind of have to take their development into the into your hands because they're not going to develop with no khl team and when the vhl team is hot garbage yeah he seems like one of those players that might be a guy that like benefits from playing at higher levels with guys who kind of see the game at a higher level think at the same kind of pace as him to maybe take advantage of some of that puck moving ability that he's got yeah but there's still the issue that you know even if they're like the players in the vhl are more mature they're older they're men but it's still crazy how that they all think at a level below uh yeah these 18 year olds it's like how much help is he getting and it's not a lot so he's more error prone there's definitely uh unforced errors though so i can't like it feels like such a cop-out to just blame the team when there's definitely some glaring issues um but i mean he's needs to develop he'll need time he's older for this class he's been playing in the vhl all year yeah i the mhl games have thrown me for a loop with him but i definitely think there's still a lot there all right so the other defenseman i want to touch on here um was alexi hamill selmy and this might be a little high um e2 i know you and i are both huge fans of his game he's a ton of fun to watch and he's one of those guys i think braden mentioned it earlier with another defenseman where you look at him and you go he probably should have more points than he actually does because he does so many things well um including in the offensive zone like this kid's a ton of fun to watch so uh itu you want to touch on his game a little bit maybe yeah he's really he's uh excellent skater and he's got good hands and offensive skill is there but i i wouldn't say he's an offensive defenseman but he's a two-way defenseman who is more offensive than some of the others and he's a really good player he just struggled just a second i'll continue on with what etude was saying though he's not necessarily an offensive player he is a two-way player and uh this kid he just does ever he makes good decisions all over the ice and he angles off well defensively um he's not a huge guy so he's not going to go in there and like crush guys or anything like that but he does a good job of getting in people's faces and in using his stick to to break up plays off or defensively so um i'm a huge fan of his game uh e2 returned beyond uh him will sell me a few months ago now and every time i watch him i'm just like yeah this kid's good like you just sometimes you just watch a player in your log you're like there's something there like you don't know exactly what he's going to turn into but there's something there that um an nhl team's really gonna like yeah um he's uh and the one thing which has been good is that he has 10 points in the 10 games after the new year so he's get got more points and he's an excellent power play player also and um just i think he's a really good prospect i don't think he's going very high but he's he's he's a really good prospect yeah he's definitely one of those guys that i think where like i had him at 51 on my rankings which was great like really high and and that was me being extremely bold with him but like if he's available in the second round or something like at the tail end of the second round like this i think he's a pick i'd make i i don't know if nhl teams will make it but he's one of those guys that i think is going to go end up going later than i would take him and uh i'm willing to put him in here at 64 as long as e2 is uh willing to back that yeah so that's just that's all right perfect uh all right now we can get ty voigt maybe uh uh toss in at 65 because i feel like he is falling a bit and and we all do yeah we've re we recognize the skill like i said the biggest thing with him is just his size like if there was a magic potion to get him to grow two inches even like it would be fantastic and he might be in the first round but um dimitri costenko is another guy i want to get in here as well um i'll put him at 66. and then let's kind of get into guys like uh this is this is where it opens up a bit uh conor lockhart uh caitlyn i know you're allowed to put the full sun in now if you want to so oh okay i'll put him at 67. yeah i'll put him make it there this is yeah this is about that range where you start to really consider him so um claire though talk about connor sorry not claire caitlyn talk about conor lockhart a little bit yeah um colin walker is one of those guys that i really liked um coming out of miami um but i'm still kind of waiting for him um he he has all the tools his skating is absolutely fantastic possibly the best out of all oh his edge work is amazing uh he plays that kind of high energy style he has a high skill level um really really good skill good hands he's on the smaller side but i don't think i'm at too much because in skating you can get around that um i'm just kind of waiting to watch him i feel like he didn't showcase what he could do last year i felt like he was a little bit buried on that yuri team he didn't get a lot of opportunity so i'm still kind of holding off a sort of definitive opinion until i can see him play again but i do have him in this kind of 60 to 80 range i think i think the the tools are there it's just waiting to see what he can kind of put together with them now yeah i think he's a guy that we can probably put him in this range because i i don't think there's um like you said there's not a huge flaw in his game in any aspect so i'm more than happy to put him here um he he's got the tools right so it's it's certainly worth worth ranking him here um one of the players i wanted to kind of touch on and maybe sammy can touch on this is is martin reissavi he's not a guy that gets a ton of talk talked about a ton um but man like i watched a couple games of his recently and there's a lot to like with him oh absolutely he's just he's sort of a player you're big in third round give him three four five years maybe he and you get effective nhl whether it is where it is in your own of on your fourth line or on your second line or third line whatever it is on a different roles uh he can do that he can do all of that if you develop him correctly there's a lot of playmaking ability production isn't there on top level just yet but i like him i like him in this range especially when you we are in the range now where you just have basically one tool that might bring might get you to the nhl and if there is a guy here who has more than one he should be ranked and about now so i think he has uh his biggest strength when it comes to further development is uh versatility yeah and uh that's that's gonna be big for some teams now america i know you've seen him a couple times too so what's your take on russ savvy yeah uh i know just that he's really quick good at for checking and uh can be really physical and like sammy said he's very he can be versatile so that's his main point and i also know that he's really good at the international level i think he was also a captain uh yeah so i totally agree uh he's a really good player so well i think yeah i think i'm happy with with getting him in here right around now and giving him the prestigious rank of 69 and nice um yeah exactly thank you nice child and we're all children here um now we get into the range where we we can start to discuss guys like uh just so anybody like to be completely honest i know i did this last time with a ranking at that 90 where i'm like all right guys like start giving me names but this draft is really at that point now and uh the one name i do want to have a discussion about though before we go any crazy further and and this is the name that that we brought up earlier a couple of times and i can see mikael's face already and that's william stronggrin so i'm gonna start so i can get a couple positives out first um he's got a lot of offensive skill he's very very skilled he's got some good size um his skating ability isn't the best but he he gets moving um he he has a shot he has the skill um he to me he's a guy that you you draft and develop he's definitely not a guy that you draft and look for to to be on your team in two years or three years even um but there's a lot there like he's a guy that i think you could toss in and he comes comes over plays at the ahl level for a year or two and then kind of makes your nhl roster he's super young a june birthday um there's a lot to like about him but i know there's a lot of concerns with his game as well so now i'll let mikhail have the floor and get to some of that well i have to say i like williams i like him but i just see his he has a ton of skill and that's no doubt that he has he has his scoring skills of course but i think whenever there's not enough space for him to take the puck from like the defensive zone and start trying to and attack the if he doesn't have the space to do to use his hands then he doesn't do anything then he he stands along the boards and he doesn't help the defend defense to get the puck out of his own he he's a little bit he's just he's just a passenger and then in the defensive zone he's uh he's like uh practice code i think compared him to uh and he's got no more i i don't see that much like aggression in the game from him otherwise unless it's towards other players um what i think we should all look at is where does he score his points and he scores his points in the junior league and he scores his points in the swedish third division hope get them so i think just when he gets to space he's very talented but he's not going to get space unless it's in hokkien or the junior league that's going to get that's going to let him do what he does best so unless he changes that then he's going to he's not gonna go anywhere like he has a very high potential like he has a very high upside but reaching that upside is less than one percent maybe like in his and his floor is where he is at now he's in hope gesture like he's he's not if he if he doesn't reach his potential he's not going to be this third or fourth liner in the nhl he's not going to be an nhl player if it doesn't reach his potential so what i'm feeling is that you have to weigh his upside towards his the rest of his game and i don't think the rest of his game is worth enough to have him in the top 100 and i might be a little bit too harsh to have him do that like not having him on the draft court at all like he could be a seventh round pick i wouldn't i wouldn't mind that at all but i i just don't think he's gonna be an nhl player ever unless he hits that 0.5 percent or whatever it's gonna be like of his upset yeah i i know what you're saying and i see it all and and like i said i'm always the guy that swings on that upside right like i'm more than willing to swing on that upside um i we don't need to put him here at 70 or anything like that but i do think we we need to get him on the one top 100 board even if it's towards the latter half um because that the shot is good the skill is good and if he were an october birthday rather than a june birthday i'd have a completely different take on him that's what i was going to say tell me the the fact that he's so young for the draft class gives me a little bit of hope that he can get that stuff going and and maybe when maybe next year he plays at the else fence can level or gets up some some more shl time and kind of shows like that that little bit more aggression and shows a little bit more pace in his game and stuff because like i said the skill and shot is there like i think he's a good playmaker and maybe he doesn't do all that much at the nhl level and he's a really crappy third liner at five on five but i think he could do some things on the power play and in his draft class like there's a lot of guys that can't do anything on any at any advantage so um i think he's worth getting in here 70 might be a little bit too high for for the for the group and everything but i do think he should be on here but let's move on to to a guy that i think kind of doesn't get a ton of uh publicity really at all and that's vladisol lukaszewicz uh dylan i know i've seen your you've been a fan of him i've seen some games where i've liked him in some games where i'm like he's a guy but give us your take on him oh yeah um i've been struggling with him also as with everyone in this draft he just hates the defensive zone and that's his biggest flaw he pinches so hard to get just a crumb of possession and just never it's like not working enough and the last game i watched with him um he was pinching basically all game so aggressively and then getting caught out uh forward has to come back and play defense for him and then a third period's like his last shift of the game he has this perfect opportunity to pinch and i'm like okay he's gonna go do it and he didn't and he went back and played defense and his team got the puck and then they cleared the zone and they got the into the offensive zone like that so it's clear that um he can play defense he just doesn't want to uh but he's really good offensively uh his desire to get the puck out of the defensive zone really helps him out it's just the defense isn't there when he gets the puck into the offensive zone he moves it so well especially on the power play he's not spamming point shots he's uh more willing to get dangerous pucks to the net uh rather than just hoping for the best that he's just frustrating but so is everyone so it's kind of difficult it's just who's more frustrating and i think that i've seen a lot of him that's good but i just haven't seen enough of him growing throughout the year that's like made me want to bump him up super high so i guess this kind of 70 to 80 range is pretty much where i kind of sit with him yeah i kind of have that opinion too like this last range is going to be tough um i'm i'm going to put them in at 70 just for getting the name in there because this rest of this range is going to be tough to to kind of differentiate between um but the one thing i did want to say before we kind of start moving on is we've been here like four hours and i'm having a great time i'm having a wonderful time and i i know all of you love seeing my big bald head and i hate you [Laughter] i should have didn't know he was coming i should have muted him before i even started talking um but no what i was going to suggest is why don't we leave it at 70 for here now because we're just gonna keep getting into the weeds going any further right now this is gonna go in forever if we don't if we don't because we're gonna we're gonna be here till like 5 30 eastern and we're going to be like oh finally got 85 and then it's going to be tough all right guys let's get out of here before dylan insults me a ton more because he's just going to do it in the dms anyways so i need to save face all right guys thanks for doing this like i said we'll uh we'll debate in slack and stuff because that's going to be where this mess gets settled [Laughter] cheers everybody all right yeah everyone bye guys all right i really hope you enjoyed that podcast it was a long one and i appreciate if

Kyle Bonis	all right first we have coach Bob Daniels coach could you please give us your thoughts on tonight's game sure um it's a really uh very similar to a lot of my thoughts have been for a lot of the games lately um from the standpoint that you know I'm happy to see the goals go in I'm concerned that we're giving up so many scoring chances against um really happy with how CJ M played tonight I thought he was worth his W to Gold tonight uh the other thing is for the second game in a row we came back for a two goal deficit early now good news on that is we're showing some resilience and some toughness the bad news is we're falling uh down by two goals early so um you know we'll we we'll hopefully continue that resilience but maybe uh find a way not to be playing from behind uh so much in the future Dan coach talk a little bit about the power play here tonight going two for three on the night as well as the penalty kill going one for five tighten it up after that the first period yeah definitely really uh happy with the penalty kill I think they scored on their first Power Play and I was disappointed with that I again it's just something to have to look at but I thought um the first minute and the half did a terrific job of killing and then we kind of leak a little oil was nervous after that uh but the guys really I thought did a terrific job I think coach coffin's in charge of the penalty kill and has done an outstanding job lately with that now in regards to to uh our power play um we had worked during the week with uh zaren uh on uh quarterbacking that power play and um all of a sudden he's out we were you know he was you know we're told now looking close to four weeks and so out of nowhere we put Travis white in that in that power play Spot I think it's up with two power play assist so uh it just shows you the less we work for the guys maybe the better off they are but you know all of a sudden there's two points and straight Travis stuff up in from a kid that a year ago couldn't even hardly see a shift and now all of a sudden he's out there in all situations I'm very proud of him and happy for him Coach can you go take you through the last two minutes of the first period just kind of some of your thoughts on that very you know you guys get two and then they add one with about 26 seconds yeah that's a good question one you all it's kind of blinked out of my mind I wasn't too upset with the they got it was great to it would have been nice go to the between perod for the two to and realistically our first goal um that cter scored was a big goal for us being down two nothing I thought we were a bit listless we were on our heels they definitely jumped us and to get that goal I thought really helped right the ship um but then their third goal was a fluky goal realistically uh with a shot it hit the boards and it it pered over the net to their player who picked it out of the air great play by him but very unfortunate bounce very unusual bounce to see it you know was almost ice level hits the backboard pops straight up over our goal right out in front uh now with that said you know that was one of you know one of the more innocent plays all night I thought they generated a lot of good scoring chances I really thought UF played very well I thought um if it had been for CJ the numbers uh instead of three goal SKS might have been closer to five and we know as coach and staff that we won't continue to win games giving up three goals a night that that's gonna just that's that's you can never count on your offense to to score that many every game and uh so we're going to need to to start paying attention to our defensive play um and like I said that number could have much higher tonight more than three goals for UF had our goal today not played so well did you feel there was a turning point in that second period you guys get three um where felt like moment was kind of in your favor at all uh not really I I I I didn't truthfully I didn't feel very comfortable until Cory K scored the six goal you know up to that point it's a two goal game it's five minutes to go I mean they bang went home now we're down to the last minute they pull a goalie we're looking at tie over time shoot out I've been there done that you know what I'm saying so no time I feel that tied ever shifted I I always felt like that game was up for grab until when Cory scored then so like okay well you know PR of the you mentioned Scot being out can you talk about the play of of players like Conor and some of the Freshman obviously Travis white stepping up in his abs yeah no I I can talk about that I thought uh Travis White's really played very well like I said he's been a blessing uh and maybe he had not been for zern going down uh Travis would have seen that in my I time he's really been shot in the arm for us we're very happy with the play of all our fres defenseman right now um but I think the biggest surprise hands down to me in terms of defenseman is that I play Travis white tripping okay thanks guys got her up buddy next we have Conor Schmid your number two star of the game who scored his first yeah playing simple counter kid just takes through that goal you saw um well came out of the bench and uh Puck squirted out and caught it and this time I had a little bit more time so I picked my head up and I know I don't have the hardest shot in the league so I tried to put it low and good screen and just found the back in that Conor you know with a lot of freshman defensive back there can you talk about the early season how you feel like you guys from beginning uh yeah like coming to college com to this level I mean like starts in the waight room like before working out you think you push yourself to limit until you came here and then you really know your limit and just preparing the preparation is a lot different and I mean our confidence level too coming to a league like this like I know my confidence is down I mean this go really help but I mean it's just we have a great group of freshman so I think we're playing well and then you the assist on the go by um yeah it was just a scamman neutral zone I stepped and saw ker break in and I just fed him and they do the rest yeah I was shoting out the you seem always out there to play with the main streak whether it's pushing or shoving after the whistle or finishing every hit is that an aspect of uh your game that you would say is a strong part uh yeah I mean I know being this height and this weight I mean I have to play like I'm 6'3 cuz I'm not 6'3 I mean that's a big part of my game but I mean I have to lay off on the penalties thank you next we have Captain Kylie bonus your number one star of the game who scored two goals tonight cap s c congratulations on the hot start four goals in five games if you could take us through uh those two goals night um well the first one was a great shot by P I kind of moving the par round really well in the power play and looking to capitalize after scored that big goal and he kind of just found the lane just banged off and he went in the second one again on the power play it wasn't our normal unit but um again was great popular guys were staying composed and trying to find lanes and an unbelievable pass it seemed like they went for a leg and a stick and every guy their found me and um I got it on the rebound after a goal made one save feels good to contribute for sure coming M you're working on power play First Time season can you talk about your you guys did tonight power play is kind of a funny thing it's it's uh really confidence-based it's something that you have to spend a lot of time almost being frustrated in practice because we do have such a good time of kill I think that really helps us we have we have guys that um that work so hard to make us better in practice every day and I think that helps us a lot in the game but it's against a team like Alaska too they uh they're really aggressive and they they play their CHS well so it's just quick Puck movement getting pucks on net and making it uncomfortable for the you feel like you know you guys felt behind nothing really the gold by Conor did that give you guys a little bit of confidence going forward yeah absolutely I think um I think we came out a little stag I thought they really took it to us for probably the first 15 minutes of that per the first period um and then was making a great play that he's a guy that like you guys said talk he plays so hard and he he really puts his heart and slow into it so especially an offensive uh contribution from a guy like that is really uplifting
Connor McDavid	Rob FS is the best 5-1 colon after 40 minutes of Play It has been all rockets and after the master car memoral cup is handed out all the attention turns to the NHL draft as far as these players are concerned and here's a shock this young man beside us right here is going to be going first overall to the Edenton Oilers Conor McDavid after a very successful Junior career the draft is next on the horizon for you and when you hear Scouts say things like he's a generational Talent he's the best player to come out of the draft since Mario Lemieux what goes through your mind Connor uh that's pretty uh that's pretty crazy I mean I don't really know if I deserve that praise or not I mean it's obviously uh very flattering and humbling but um I really haven't done too much it's uh you know I haven't played a game in NHL or anything like that so um there's a lot of work left to be done now I haven't seen you since the uh the draft lottery and a lot of people saw your reaction that night and thought oh he's disappointed to be going to the Edmonton Oilers or that the Oilers won the draft lottery and I know you've been trying to set the record straight on that a little bit yeah yeah I I mean I don't know why anyone would be disappointed about going to the Edmonton oers I mean look at guys like obviously the the names Wayne Gretzky and you know all the different names it's uh such a historic franchise you were a bit shocked by the whole thing yeah obviously um you know I kind of just you know whatever that that those four balls those four numbers kind of decided to know at least a little bit of Fate for myself and um you know I was certainly in shock I mean I don't really know what to say uh it was uh certainly a crazy time and um I guess uh I guess the reaction was more just shock than anything so Connor uh Gary Roberts designs the summer program for you what kind of things are you guys working on to get ready for NHL training camp yeah um you know you look at a guy like Gary and his track record that he's had and and the number of players that he's trained that have been so successful and um you know it's it's a credit to him he's he's so uh you know gifted when it comes to know that off ice training and um you know with him he's not just taking care of your you know in gym he's taking care of your life style and make sure you're eating right you're doing all the right things you're getting enough rest so um you know he really takes care of you and um you know I'm very lucky to to be around guys like that you've played in front of some very emotional fans before but sometimes the Quebec fans can take it up to the next level you ever seen anything like that no that's actually the first time I've I've ever seen that and um and I I don't really like seeing that that's uh that's dangerous for the players it's dangerous for for everyone involved the refs and um you know even the fans if someone's throwing one from you know the top row and they don't EX have the arm you know it could hit someone up front so um you know you don't like seeing that but obviously the old school uh old school guys may may have seen that but WIS Arena Jeff WIS Arena no I know Todd we know Todd well I mean it was a great year for the you and the otter disappointment though not to be out there competing for the Memorial Cup of course yeah um It's upsetting um but we had a we had a very good run and um you know we have no regress we we uh you know played some very good hockey obviously beating a very good suit team was uh you know I guess uh our kind of OHL Championship for ourselves so um you know ashaa deserves to be here everyone's seen that they've had such a great week and um you're going to see a great team there on Sunday and talk about Asha if you would and what it was that they do well to beat you yeah um you know they play uh you know such strong defense and uh you know they're always back they're always above pucks and um you know they're obviously very well coached and they're very disciplined and um you know they score timely goals and um you know you look at the The Upfront guys like Cole castles Michael dcole they've always uh you know been there and um you know they're key guys so are they your pick uh I'm going to stay neutral I I don't want to the team they've been doing great so um some great hockey from you this year it was a pleasure to watch you play Junior best of luck in your NHL career Conor thank you so much Conor McDavid uh now forly of the are aor soon to be joining the NHL and with all due respect to Ivan Pro off for the Brandon we Kings and Teo Meer of the Halifax Boose heads your Lin made by the way the top prospects game top draft pick nominees there's probably only one Conor McD third period still the comp [Music]
	hello Kent Johnson hi cigaret Glenn it's really nice to finally make it to a history interview well we're so happy to have you we're going to ask you a few questions about your personal history okay and first question is how did you become a behavior analyst ah Funny Thing Happened on my way to a government degree at Georgetown University in Washington DC when I went off to college there to become uh someone like an ambassador for some I didn't know exactly but government was my uh my um focus and uh I uh uh had a math requirement to register for in my freshman year and I was given some options and asked to choose which option I wanted and uh uh there were two calculus options one was a standard lecture discussion recitation section Calculus class and one was a uh a class run by uh a method called the personalized system of instruction and that summer before I went to Georg I got a brief uh description of this of this style of teaching and it was very intriguing to me and I somewhat adventurous Soul so I said I'm going to pick that uh that PSI option so I got to Georgetown and I took the Calculus class and uh uh you know it was designed uh in units there were 20 units and you had to do an interview about the content and fill out a practice work sheeet for each of the units and you had to get 90% or better on the on the checkout before you could move to the next unit and you go at your own pace and there were all these other students who had been through the course present uh it was a very large class but it felt really small there were about 400 of us and it felt like I was in a class of uh you know 50 uh you spent time with Proctors who could explain the material that you read in the textbook or you and if you wanted to or you could do your checkouts and have a conversation about calculus and uh make sure you could uh complete all the exercises and moved to the next one and I was done by Halloween and I had my a and I was just just loved the the method uh and I asked the teacher the math teacher Barbara Reese I asked what Barbara where how uh did you invent this this teaching method and she said no the people over in Psychology you should go over and talk to them if you're really interested in it's Charles fer and uh and they'll tell you all about it so while I went over over to psych and uh and then I met all the behavior analysts that were in the department it was a psychology department so it wasn't all Behavior analysts but I did meet the several who were uh and uh you know next thing I know I'm a psych major so that leads me to my next question which is how what was it like to be a behavior analyst at that time and in that place well uh in the60s uh and we're talking 69 to 73 actually when I was in in college besides the the being in Washington DC during the uh Vietnam war protest which had its own level of excitement uh uh Opera conditioning uh was uh really the ascendant psychology at the time uh there was very little of what we now call cognitive psychology around uh uh uh there was so much literature uh it was an exciting time it felt I felt like I was part of a fairly new field uh whose major spokesman founder was still alive Fred Skinner he would come to campus uh Fred Keller who was the mentor of Charles fer and uh and later Gil Sherman uh uh they were all still alive and kicking and just uh convincing the world and you know and it was also an exciting time in the 60s you know we're all we're all we were all about saving the world so you know it was like Better Living Through behaviorism as uh dick mot would say on his bumper stickers he'd hand out you know to to students and uh and it was just an it was just a remarkable uh time in our field you're lucky to have been there at that time oh oh I'm so lucky so after you um after you completed your degree and you went on to your PhD at Massachusetts yes University of Massachusetts Amherst uh I remember I um uh was trying to figure out which of the five or seven or so Behavior Analysis oriented py departments I wanted to study in uh and really who did I want to study with with and so when I was a kid uh and I do want to get back to what I was doing when I was a kid that's related to this Believe It or Not uh I uh um was uh interested in getting back into uh working with children and teaching uh kids uh I had done a whole lot of research on PSI actually uh with people at Georgetown and later in graduate school but I did want to work with somebody who was uh uh doing this kind of work with children and psychology today came out uh with a special issue called the behavior Shapers at work and it was 1972 and psychology today as a magazine was very popular at the time it's still around you still see it at the at the uh the checkout counters and in stores and things but it really was was uh a big deal so I we all had subscriptions to that um and uh the behavior Shapers that worked uh uh had uh a description of 42 different Behavior analysts who were kind of in the top 40 plus two of people doing that work and I so I read each com it was a fabulous way to decide where to go to school uh and I read each of the columns uh related to each person and Beth Soler AAR then Beth Soler was uh uh one of the people described and uh I said you know she had been uh doing a lot of work in the token economy with children and she worked with children in inner city schools and children with poverty she was a actually had been an elementary school teacher in Harlem before she uh followed her husband into U higher at her her husband Ed Soler was a big behavior analyst uh uh as well and uh so I I went and studied with her I applied to UMass and I also applied to another big department was Kansas I really had a you know should I go to the University of Kansas should I go to work with Beth instead but I I finally picked to to work with Beth well you said a minute ago about your early interest in children uh leads me to my next question which is uh relates to your career that you did over time and of course it does have to do with working with children can you tell us how that came about uh my sister uh there weren't these diagnoses around uh that like there are today for children every child has some label or another these days it's a big industry of assessment and diagnosis uh there um and she really struggled and I mean she probably has a mild language learning disability or something if you thought about it in in the current uh Century uh but she was struggling with math so it's keeping orderly about the steps of arithmetic was just really a challenge for her so my mother asked me if I would help her CU I really liked school and uh I really liked math and we called it arithmetic then and uh I worked with her and we had a great time uh and she learned a lot of math and you know it really turned her her around her grades around in school and then other relatives uh in our family said well could you work with Andre my cousin and you know I started working with different uh different uh people in uh our family extended family and uh I come from a Entre background so everybody in my family does their own thing no one works for anybody and so I had that Spirit that's how I was growing up and so I said you know what I'm going to see who else in the neighborhood might be interested in this and so I made a flyer and I passed it out and I charged 10 cents a session and this was when I was nine and by the time I was 12 I had 40 kids and I did be come to my backyard and in fact the neighborhood that I lived in in Milford Connecticut the neighborwood was named Morningside so that's the name of uh our school now is Morningside Academy uh but the name comes from my childhood and uh and I would group them uh by their needs at different tables we had in the backyard and I'd recruit neighborhood children to help me with it with the job and so I built this little you know it's like Spanky and Our Gang or The Little Rascals or something and uh so so I was uh I just really enjoyed uh kind of a very primitive version of something like what we do right now at morning side so I'm very fortunate you know people not knowing what they want to be when they grow up you know I never had that I always had too many things to choose from and so I did go back to that childhood uh love that I had for working with children and helping them uh uh learn in school I remember being in second grade and seeing the teacher Miss Mrs mern would call on me and then move on you know and I said wait a minute don't call on me what about Stephen you know he isn't following this so I had this very this concern about people being left behind and uh No Child Left Behind and uh so all of that has really come to fruition for me and my um but now I have a technology of of Behavior Analysis to really make this uh this this shine so uh you worked pretty much all your career uh in at morning side developing it creating it developing the developing the technology and out of all the things you've done which have been many since I've known you uh what would you like to be remembered for what aspect of your work I'd like to be remembered as a a behavior analyst who was not um afraid or was really interested in looking outside of what Behavior analysts create uh and finding things that seem to be seem to work that exist outside of a behavioral framework and incorporating them with a in a translation of what that is know anything that's effective can be understood Behavior analytically uh and so I like to be known for the the uh a person who reaches out and brings uh other promising methods and curriculum into a behavioral framework uh to maximize what behavior analyst can do I mean we need to operate within the whole world as it exists and all of what's what's promising and not restrict ourselves to things that are only currently described in behavioral analect terms or created in Behavior analytic terms and I have to credit Charlie fer for opening my eyes on there I remember he would say it was all about translation he described Behavior Analysis as uh uh a microscope so he was a very metaphorical uh uh person he said behavior analysis is a microscope through which you view the world uh from this lens this particular lens so I remember one uh time he says we're going to read some Harry stack Sullivan you know Harry stack Sullivan he's one of those Disciples of Freud you know he's a Neo FR and yes we're going to read it because it's really a be if you read the psychiatric interview it's really behavioral so he was always saying you know it's really behavioral and you'd read it and be like well where is the behavior analysis and he said well then that's our land we we create the behavior analysis of it but it's really behavioral so I I really that was a a very important uh message that I learned as an undergraduate uh that has really uh uh suited me well in morning side so 1969 to 73 you were in school and since then you've been a behavior analyst for sure and the four years of graduate school so 77 I got out all these years yeah um how has Behavior Analysis changed since then how's it different or is it different well uh we we've uh as a field we've really been about the business of developing uh promising uh ideas that were generated back in the kind of the idea time I think of the 60s and 70s as our big idea you know the Big Ideas time and developing those into a uh a natural science of behavior and that's been a very important uh work it has taken our eyes off other big ideas and it has made us rather insular uh and I do always think back to Charlie about you looking outside and seeing what we you know we need to expand our our purview uh and include other po possible promises I so so I think that the field uh risks some things by being so insular I understand a science needs to be focused very focused so I do appreciate the focus but I do think that there's room for looking outside uh there's there's a man for example we have we brought a method in from a a cognitive psychologist named Arthur wimy who then decided he was well maybe I'm really not a cognitive psychologist maybe I'm a mental behaviorist he said uh he had a methodology called thinking aloud problem solving that we just have fully embraced it's so it's so scaran you know when you really it was very easy to translate that one and he really came along for the ride that's been a big breakthrough you know people say Behavior analysts don't do work in uh problem solving and creativity well uh we do we can do that work uh we haven't we haven't expanded ourselves to fully Embrace uh some of what other people in social science are interested in and but we could you know I I'm a I'm a I believe we could analyze everything in a behavioral framework so I'm not like a just a methodological behaviorists at all though there's a lot of methodological behaviorism that's running uh uh rampant now that I would like to see uh uh you know it takes a village we need people who are interested in parametrics and interested in methodologies and uh but we also need uh new ideas in our field and so just to bring talk a lot of problem solving into uh which is what we call it thinking a lot of problem solving talk a lot problem solving we teach the kids how to problem solve how to be able to figure out how to do what they don't know how to do without teaching uh because you know you can't learn everything that you need to be a successful person in school I mean it just couldn't happen in 12 years so you have to be able to be generative and you have to be able to take what you know and figure out what you don't know uh and it's really important to teach our kids how to do that because our kids need more explicit work in teaching them how to be successful uh in their lives it's the it's not going to be something that they automatically grasp with you know the struggling Learners that we do work with uh so I think that's uh uh that our field would do well to look at uh at things outside of our area and incorporate them we ought to be like the the Pacman you know we ought to be incorporating everything that is uh operative out there and successful we really should do more that so that's what I'd say sounds good to me if you had to to do all over again would there be anything in your historical path that you would do differently well uh you know I'm tempted to say uh I wish I wasn't so naive about business when I just launched into morning side at 27 with my Mastercard and my banker who had a child who needed tutoring who sympathized with me gave me a little money to get started I mean it was a long call in those 10 years so what I when I and when I think about what would I do differently the first thing that I think about is what can I offer to other Behavior analysts younger Behavior analysts and that would be some more um in uh instruction in how to start an opera business not to scare people away from it I mean I you know I'm if I had known what I really needed to know to be entirely efficient at running a a school I might not have done it it might have been a little daunting for me so I'm glad I had a little bit of uh impulsivity around it but uh but I uh I do I the first 10 years were a struggle and I I would do those differently but otherwise I think I would take Behavior Analysis to the streets I think that's that's my calling in this work I could have been a you know I love to ride I published lots of papers in graduate school I could have done the the university uh academic thing but I just think my my calling was taking it into the streets and helping kids so what areas of behavior analysis you do have a broad perspective and I think that this would be especially interesting question for you what areas of behavior analysis would do you believe we need more work in um I think we need more uh theoretical and conceptual work uh that's followed up with uh uh uh uh a a immediately followed up with a quest for uh making a technology uh experimenting with Big Ideas in a technological framework uh is uh I guess that's how I would I would capture what I'd like to see more of not just conceptual uh analyses uh but very pragmatically implications of those for on the ground work that we do uh you know U we ought to develop for example uh conceptual analysis the problem solving and creativity two areas that come to mind and immediately begin designing procedures based on those technology and immediately going to application uh in uh an experimental framework to verify what our conceptual analyses are you know it's what's on the ground you know I'm a big American pragmatist you know what's good what's true uh and what's good is what works and uh we ought to you know already there are conceptual analyses that kind of stay dangling in our in our body of uh writing in Behavior Analysis and we ought to be experimenting with how to uh how to bring those to uh the ground to the street level so looking into the future which is always hard but imagine sort of projecting forward and say what do you think Behavior Analysis would will be like it's let's say 50 years from now what where where do you think we'll be well we and so we want to F we want to look at where the culture uh more generally is going uh you know to help us focus a little bit uh as our uh Western culture particularly in America becomes more corporatized uh we ought to be looking at uh methods for uh running larger and larger organizations we ought to be uh doing good uh kind of behavior analytic work to uh make people happier uh and make organiza larger organizations more successful uh through Behavior Analysis so I I see that's one huge area and you know we do have people who work on organizational behavior uh analysis but they tend to work on organizational behavior management from the point of view of managers and they do also Tinker with micro uh contingencies that can be uh put in place in organizations I'm talking more about just working more with uh the contingencies at large in organizations and making them um more um like the whole analysis of leadership is really important as as our country runs uh in organizations that are larger and larger you know what is leadership and how you know in a behavioral sense you know the success of leadership is uh born out in the behavior of the followers of the leader and to focus on the followers and look at what how the lead how leaders influence followers and is that for good or not good and what those implications are for leadership I think those are that's an important area and and you know um looking at education uh as we grapple with larger and larger populations uh and you know a lot more people uh uh are in school now than they were when I was in school and so what does that have to what's the implication of that for how schools operate you know uh we can't you know so how does a teacher who is really faced with 30 or more kids now in a lot of uh cities in America how did that how how does it how does that change the the nature of uh of teaching you know how can we enlist the services of the children in the teaching of each other how can we make this more personalized uh from uh uh in how can we make schools more personalized and more effective back to psi yeah I really I do go back to that root but the implications of that for for children like we've developed this whole peer coaching methodology at morning side and uh and it's really has a lot to and you know these are't children that you'd pick out of uh of typical classrooms to be coaches of other children but what is the preparation for children like the struggling Learners that come to Morningside that that makes them very effective uh uh coaches of each other as we deal with larger and larger systems so you know you know when classrooms are as large as uh 40 or or more we really can't continue to use the the designs that we cooked up uh back in the day when there were 15 to 20 children in the classroom isn't gonna isn't going to work pretty soon we're going to get to the point where it's it's really we're we're really our schools are not really doing a very good job uh right now and so there's a lot of work to do in organizational analysis of that of schools so that's those are some of where we might go in the future okay so think about students out there and one of the reasons we're doing these interviews is we hope the students of the future will find them interesting uh about the history of behavior analysis from the personal standpoint of people who were there and who participated and the personal repertoire and histories and so forth but often we're called upon to sort of distill what we think is the most important thing we can hand over to a student what can we say to them that might might be something for them to hold on to as they proceed through in their careers what message would you like to give to students current and in the future learn how to be agile uh that's my current um my current uh Focus um how do you uh learn to adjust your uh Behavior to the constantly shifting contingencies that are occurring as uh America gets bigger uh how can you uh not get stuck in your Frameworks um how can you be agile uh how can you you quickly adapt to the changing contingencies that are occurring in your uh now in your school life and then later in your career life uh and not do it the old way uh because the old way is uh a different context than the new way so agility is a real is is a really uh important uh goal I think for our students in Behavior Analysis to to adapt to how can you adapt to the world uh and bring behavior and else along with you I think that's very important well thank you Kent that was most interesting I enjoyed it very much oh I enjoy it too

Connor McDavid	Chris Knobblock is the head coach of the Eerie Otter, the team that McDavid currently plays for. He joins us by phone from Erie, Pennsylvania. And Chris, I know you're about to head into practice shortly with Connor and the rest of the team. What do you think you'll say to him? Um, I'm not sure. Um, I'm going to see him in probably about 5 minutes there, right after this phone call. And uh, um, yeah, I don't sure. I'm sure he's a little excited and um, maybe a little bit relieved and now he knows where he's most likely going. So, um, yeah, we'll just see how it goes. What was your reaction when you heard that Edmonton had won the draft lottery? Um, well, um, you know, I didn't have any preferences where he went or I I think there'll be an excellent opportunity for him there and um um I don't know, it's a little bit ironic what's going on with our team and the Edmonton Oilers, but um, you know, I think wherever Connor is going to go, he will thrive and be a an excellent NHL player. Why is it ironic? Uh just with our uh our team, our financial situation of uh and um the transfer of ownership, what was almost happened with the Edmonton Oilers and uh now that our star player going to uh Edmonton, do you do you think Connor had a preference of where he would end up? Um I don't think so. I think uh maybe a little bit of being a a Toronto guy um growing up there, but uh I I I don't think he had a preference of where he went uh or any places that he had scratched off his list. So, um yeah, no, I think he's open to wherever he's going. Um he's kind of in the same situation being a 15-year-old coming into our league of you know not choosing a lot of players in the Ontario Hockey League sometimes choose where they go and where they not. Connor never done that and has no understood that it's part of uh hockey just to go wherever you're drafted and not be um particular what city you choose. What makes him a great player? Well, I think it's just his he has exceptional talents and there's players that can shoot the puck really well or stick handle and skate and have great on ice awareness. Um Connor, what makes him special is he's got all of that. And when you you put it all together, you get the the Conor McDavid uh product where he's just a exceptional hockey player. Do you think when people start saying he they compare him to Gretky, they compare him to Crosby, they compare him to Lemieux. Is that fair? Is that Is he in that league? Um I think he's going to be in an excellent hockey player and uh just to say he's the next um Sydney Crosby or Wayne Gretzky, I think it's really unfair. Um he's a one heck of a hockey player and he will be successful. So I think Connor will write his story and he will dictate of how good he's going to be. What's he like as a guy? He is a great guy and sometimes you get uh players with exceptional talent and have some uh um arrogance to them or feel that they're entitled to certain things and Connor is none of that. He's a team first guy, a player um who's just a perfect player to coach. Um where he's you have somebody who has exceptional talent, but he's a team first guy. The players on the team love him being around with him. He's one of the most popular guys, but he's he's cares about winning first and his performance second. Chris, good to speak with you. Thank you very much. Well, thanks for having me. Chris Knobblock is the head coach of the Eerie Otter.
Connor McDavid	Yeah, it's been exciting. Of course, um you always kind of uh had this uh this date mark on my calendar for a while. Uh you know, the comment is uh become a little bit of a tradition for uh you know, math eligible players. So, it's been a fun week. Did you have many interviews considering you kind of know what's going to happen here and Edmonton kind of knows what's going to happen. Did you have very many? Uh no, I didn't have too many. You know, more than one? Yeah. Does this the attention here, the amount of media cameras here? How accustomed to are you of this uh and and what is your impression of the attention right now? Yeah, I mean this is uh probably the biggest mediest SC I've ever done. So um you know, world juniors included. So uh this has been a big turnout and um I understand obviously with an draft it's a pretty big deal. So um it's kind of the last step towards that. So, um, it's great to see the the people come out. And Conor, it's one thing watch. Sorry, Conor. It's one thing to read everything about you. It's another thing to hear everything about you, but when you come in closer at the combine, now coming to the draft, do you feel like you are the best player in this draft class? Uh, that's not up for me to decide. Um, you know, I think a lot of people do a lot of talking and and uh, you know, they'll judge uh for their own eyes. Um, you know, I believe in my abilities and that's the main thing. But I feel I'm the best player in the draft. Um, I'm not sure. Maybe you'll hear a different answer from Jack, but um, we'll see. Did you watch or pay attention to him during the year? Did you watch it? No, not too much. Um, obviously you just got to worry about yourself and and make sure you're handling your own business and um, you know, you're ready to go each and every night. So, um, I thought I did a pretty good job of, uh, you know, not letting it get to me. Do you welcome the comparisons to Jack, though? You welcome that kind of it might be a rivalry in years to come. Yeah, I think uh, we'll be linked together for a little bit here at least. Um, you know, it's uh been good. Have you Have you noticed how life is beginning to change? I mean, this is this scrum, this is probably not going to be the last time you have a scrum of this size in your career, even in the next couple of weeks. Uh, yeah. Um, getting more and more used to it, of course. Uh, been dealing with it for a little bit now. And, um, it's something I like doing. It's fun to to do this. And um you know obviously uh I like to play hockey more than than this stuff but you have your responsibilities and and um you know it's it's a good problem to have. You got to know Jack at all. Have you gotten to know Jack at all? You said a few months ago you really didn't know at all together this Yeah, I got to know him a little bit better. Um you know it's been interesting obviously uh you've been linked together for so long now. You start to feel like uh you know him and um it was good to finally meet him and get to know him a little bit better. What'd you find out about him? This is a nice step. What's the value of this combine for you? I mean, if if it really is almost predetermined where you're going to go, at least from our perspective, what's the value in testing for you? Uh, not to embarrass myself, uh, Bennett tweeted me today, said, uh, watch out for that pull-up bar. So, so, uh, so of course I I don't think, uh, I want to get zero by any means, but I mean, you look at a guy like Sammy and, um, you know, what an unbelievable year he had, uh, or at least finished the year he had in the playoffs. I think, uh, his, uh, his combine experience is long gone for or forgotten. Hey, Connor, going going back to the the day of the lottery, it was hard to read your reaction, so I figured I just ask you about it. I don't know if it was like shock. Yeah, it was more like it was Have you been asked about that? Like it was uh once or twice. Wasn't exactly elation. Yeah, once or twice I've been asked that. So, um yeah, it was more just shock than anything. Uh you know, kind of for a couple years now. It's it's been, you know, you're expecting one thing, you're told one thing, this is going to happen, and then in a whole instant it's not the case. You know what I mean? So, um it was uh an exciting day. Um I was more just shocked than I think. Have you accepted the possibility that Edmonton will be your land? You know, likely land. We'll take this last question about the lottery and then we'll move on. Very good. Okay. Um Okay. Um yeah. Um yeah, I mean uh there's nothing to accept. If it's Edmonton, it's great. I mean, I'll be so happy if it's Edmonton. If it's not, then it'll be great as well. I mean, it doesn't really matter. Everywhere is great in the NHL. Last year spent a lot of time around Aaron when he went through this. So, what did you learn from that experience and how does this compare to that? Um, you know, I obviously am very good friends with Aaron and and both Sams and um it was a lot of fun for me just to kind of follow along. Was more of a fan last year and um of course kind of asked them about their experience and they said obviously come draft time it uh it ramps up a bit and you know they're more than right. So Connor, you've been a teammate of Dillings now for for a couple years. What can you say about him as a player? He's unbelievable. His hockey IQ is off the charts. Um, you know, what he's able to do in in terms of finding people with the puck and um, you know, making great passes. Um, you know, it's it's so fun to watch. Um, um, I' I often times find myself just uh, you know, kind of watching them when I'm on the bench and, you know, a guy like that you can always uh, you know, learn some stuff off of. What kind of questions did you get from teams other than Edmonton in the interview process? Uh, all very straightforward. Nothing too uh too particular. How many other teams other than Edmonton did you meet? Uh, a couple. Any test that you're kind of looking forward to tomorrow? Uh, I'm not sure if you you look forward to the the tests, but I mean it's it's it's going to be fun. It's going to be exciting. And um, you know, it's always a new challenge. So, uh, it'll be interesting. Wherever you can perhaps go. You mentioned this is kind of the last step before the draft. Are you grateful for that that it's kind of coming to an end here? Uh no. It's something that you kind of want to save or um you only go through the draft process once. Um it's something that uh been looking forward to for a long long time now and um you know it's it's going to be obviously so happy when you get drafted, but um you know that's kind of when the hard work starts. Um, you know, there's no uh no more junior life or or anything like that if I'm lucky enough to to move on.
	all right for the first of what i am anticipating to be many discussions about the nhl draft it is our director of scouting mr craig button craig second time in four years the sabres will choose first overall they took the dalai lama rasmus daleen last time he is a defenseman looks like they're going to take another one in owen power this time does he fit with the sabres need well here's what i would say about owen power jay is is that he fits what any team needs a top-notch defenseman that can control the game and have command in every single situation we watch victor hedman play with the tampa bay lightning and the way the defensemen play in today's nhl they play forward and they play with a real initiative in terms of making sure that they're not backing up and on their heels well that's how oman power plays listen victor hedman's unique i'm not saying that owen power is like uh victor hedman but in terms of his ability to control the game and all its critical and essential areas it is outstanding i call him the s man for superb sense strong skills and superior size and he combines all of those elements into a player that can do so many different things in the game and if you're a coach and you have owen power on on the ice you have comfort you have a real sense of calm because you know he has things under control when he's out on the ice i mean you said it craig the sabers basically need everything so this guy is going to help no doubt about it now that you have the canucks taking forward kent johnson out of michigan at nine you have the sends taking forward mason mctavish at 10 and you have calgary taking cole sillinger at 12. why do you feel those players are particularly good fits for canada's three non-playoff teams craig and i'm really happy you said that why are they good fits listen i don't know who the teams are going to take i look at the draft i try to assess it based on you know what players could fit at certain team style what players i think could be available and that's where i go from there but kent johnson is is a really creative imaginative center and he he plays the game with the same type of mindset as elias patterson in fact jay you know physique wise he's very similar to elias patterson at the same stage but his ability to to make things happen out of seemingly nothing he's got great confidence with his hands he handles the puck in traffic he doesn't shoot the puck like elias patterson but he's got a sneaky good shot you can't sleep on him when he has the puck and think he's just going to pass it because he can score goals and an essential requirement to play in the national hockey league is the ability to operate in tight spaces and kent johnson does that exceptionally well mason mctavish is a good strong two-way center he's got a good shot he can score but he's got a real fire and determination in his game and a real good strong two-way component dave barr who coached him at the u18 championship where canada won a gold medal said he plays the game like ryan o'reilly that's pretty darn good you'll take ryan o'reilly on your team and certainly that type of player and for the calgary flames cole sillinger he's not going to dazzle you he's not gonna wow you he's not gonna make the highlights on sc with jay at midnight but i'll tell you what he's gonna help you win a lot of games he he's got great sense for the game he understands you know what play needs to happen anywhere on the ice he's a great competitor he doesn't allow himself to be denied and you know i guess the only thing working against cole sillinger going to the calgary flames it was one of the very few teams that his father mike didn't play for so mike doesn't have a calgary flames jersey to pass on to his son i will say this you love to have that pedigree though don't you you just love it there's something magical about that and i'm sure calgary would love to get him first round of the draft by the way goes july the 23rd so lots of time between now and then for us to continue to talk to craig about the draft craig thank you you
Connor McDavid	Connor, you were granted exceptional status about two and a half years ago. Has the time flown by to this year draft year or has it been a case of finally it's here? Uh, a little bit of both to be honest. I mean, looking back, I can't believe how how fast it went, but then you also look back and and realize, you know, all my friends are now drafted to the NHL and a lot of them signed and, you know, a couple of them will play there. So, it's uh you know, time is is it's been some sometimes it's flying, sometimes I mean it's just standing still, but uh you know, I'm I'm really happy it's it's finally here and um it's it's been a good couple years, but uh you know, I'm really looking forward to you know, my draft year. I know when you were six years old and you desperately wanted to play rep hockey, but they wouldn't let you do it. That your mom sat down with you and drew a sort of a staircase and each step represented one game left in the house league that you were playing in and that was sort of to get you through and realize that thing you haven't had to do anything like that to get to your draft year. Uh, no, not a whole lot. I mean, uh, grown up a little bit since 6 years old and and the staircase is kind of not so much, but, uh, it's, um, yeah, it's been a great couple years and and I'm really, you know, happy that, uh, it's finally here and and have the opportunity to, you know, prove myself to to maybe be the first overall pick. I interviewed you a year ago and you were talking about your first year in the OHL that I think you said you felt like a little rat that because you were so so thin and you weren't very strong compared to the the older kids and you noticed a big difference in your second year. You're now entering your third year. How much more stronger and faster do you feel this year than even last year? I actually think that, you know, the the jump from my second year to my third year has been even greater than than my first to my second. Um, you know, I've I've put on, you know, a little bit of weight. I'm I'm taller and um you know I feel I feel really good. So um it's it's certainly a little bit different when I was 15 years old about 510 160 soaking wet. So it's uh it's uh it's it's been a good couple of years. What's your exact height and weight right now? Uh be about 61. We'll say 61 and uh about 190. You've always been a notorious goal setter. You've you've always set very specific goals for yourself. What are your goals for this season? Uh I have a couple personal ones that uh you know I don't think you know you guys need to know about, but I mean obviously one of them would be um it'll be the first overall pick. Um you know play on a world junior team again, win a you know a gold medal and and an OHL championship and then you know maybe Cup. I mean those some pretty pretty lofty goals but you know I think you know the team we have in the area it's it's very possible and you know the the group of talent there is in in Canada I think the gold medal is possible as well. So um you know I don't see why this year can't be you know anything but you know special. Do you think you'll look at the NHL standings more this year or more precisely maybe look at the bottom of the NHL standings more? Maybe a little bit but um you know you just got to worry about yourself. I mean, uh, you know, they say you could be the first overall pick, but there's there's such a, you know, a good draft class this year, and, you know, the list goes on and on. So, you just got to, you know, keep working and and make sure you're uh you're staying at at the top of your game. So, I saw some comments from you where you talked about, you know, when you're draft if if someone's drafted number one overall that you just go to the team that drafts you. And I mean, when you were drafted number one overall to Erie, a lot of people wondered, would you report to Erie and that you had some pretty strong comments about that? How what's your thought on that? Yeah, it's pretty upsetting. You see it more at the OHL level and I think it's it's just wrong to be honest. It's um you know, you put yourself ahead of the game and it can never be like that. I mean, hockey is a is a pretty special game and and we're all lucky, you know, to to be able to play in it and and to put yourself ahead of the game and and, you know, select where you're going to go, it's it's not fair. I mean, there's a draft for a reason and the team picks the best available player or the team that, you know, the the player that, you know, suits them best and um, you know, for the player to to say, I don't want to go there and, you know, I only want to go there, it's it's it's not right. this draft has been built, the Conor McDavid draft or Conor McDavid versus Jack Eel. When you hear that sort of stuff, what do you think about that? It's pretty special. It's something that you grow up to to put yourself in this, you know, situation. I mean, that's that's why you work hard and and um, you know, have a have a good couple first years. It's it's all about, you know, putting yourself in a situation like this and um, you know, it's just, you know, it's got to stay the same. You got to keep working hard. You got to keep doing your stuff to to stay at the top or else, you know, someone's going to knock you off. So, do you take it as a a personal thing in terms of a competition between you and Jack Eel? No, it's not personal. It's uh it's about going number one. It's not about beating Jack Eel or Noah Hannathan or Dylan Stro. It's it's being, you know, the number one overall pick. Have you had any head-to-head history outside of last year's last year's World Junior with Eel? Because I know he's a a late 96 birthday. you all you're 97, but you always played up. Did you guys play each other in minor hockey growing up? I never really came across his name in minor hockey, but uh I think the first time I saw him play and played against him was at the U7 tournament and uh we had an absolute shootout in the U7 tournament and uh I think we went back and forth and I think the final score was 4-4 and we ended up going to a shootout and you know they they won the game. So, but uh you know, we kind of went back and forth, but uh you could tolerate from there that he was he was a pretty special player. You've seen him enough at World Juniors and U17 and that to probably give us a pretty good scouting report on him. What would Connor scouting report on Jack Eel be? Yeah, he's a good skater. He's a powerful skater. He's he's a big guy. He can shoot the puck. He likes to shoot it. Uh he loves his tow drag and and all that, but um he's a great player. I mean, he could score. He can pass. He's he's a big guy. So, um you know, there's not a whole lot he can't do. In some ways, you probably have more in common or more familiar with the guys that got drafted last year because those were the guys you you played against in minor hockey all the way up. Yeah, I could probably tell you, you know, anything you need to know about last year's draft, but I couldn't tell you a whole lot about this year's draft. Um, you know, except for the local guys and, you know, some of the higherend talents that that everyone's been talking about. So, uh, really know a whole lot of people and and you know, the the events like the the, you know, CHL top prospects game will be a little different. Might be the the loner outside looking in. I mean, don't really know a whole lot of guys. So, um, but, uh, you know, I'm looking forward to the pressure and expectation level is is is enormous and that and and I think you you obviously cope with that and and deal with it and that. Does it ever get to be a little bit much? uh it can be a little bit much at the beginning of the year when all the pressures of the start of the year and all that that stuff can can kind of add up, but once you find, you know, your rhythm and you get into a groove and, you know, a routine, it kind of all goes away. And um I'm pretty lucky to be up in Eerie. I mean, there's there's not a whole lot that that goes on media wise. And so it's um it's it's not too bad. That's probably been a blessing, hasn't it? playing in an American I'm sure the Otterers are big in Erie, but if you were in a a Canadian city, I would imagine it would be ramped up that much more. Yeah. Yeah. Playing in Erie has been, you know, an absolute blessing. And um you kind of get hidden hidden a bit, but you know, up there it's all about the otter and it's not about one player. They just love their team and um so it's it's it's great. When the pressure builds, is there is there a particular way that you take refuge from that or you diffuse the pressure? Um, there's a couple things I do that, you know, just our personal stuff and and you just kind of get back to the basics. You know, you just work hard, practice. That's that's the main thing. Once the when times get tough, you just got to bear down and and, you know, get back to the basics and and do everything that, you know, got you there and and it'll all work out. Pressure ra amps up even more because of the World Juniors. And this year it's in Toronto, Montreal, which takes it to another level. And there's a New Year's Eve game. Canada, United States, McDavid, Eel. I mean, it it'll get even crazier than it's been, I would imagine, at any time in the last number of years for you. Yeah. And uh you know, it's a pretty big storyline, I guess. I don't know how they how they wrote that one. But, um, it'll it would if if I'm fortunate enough to be able to play on team Canada and, you know, he's playing on the American team and and all that stuff, it uh I know it'll be a pretty pretty crazy game, but um, you know, the the World Juniors being in Toronto, Montreal is is a dream if you're be if you're, you know, forced up to be able to play on that. It's it would be just crazy. When you were a younger kid, I'm assuming you watched the World Juniors on TV. And do you have any memories, specific memories from that, especially New Year's Eve games against the Americans? Oh, of course, of course. I every boxing day, you know, watch first game and New Year's Eve. I mean, I I watched them all, but uh I don't know, probably like a favorite memory would be obviously Everly's, you know, 5second left and Gord Miller with the great call and all that stuff, but uh also, you know, Tavvaris's hattick, New Year's Eve hattick, you know, the Canadians got down pretty good and and he just kind of put him on his back and and you know, won the game, you know, for them. But, uh that was a pretty special of a game for him. How hard was it last year with the team not getting a medal and and maybe the tournament not going the way you would have liked personally? Yeah, it uh obviously it wasn't a storybook ending to the world, you know, your first World Juniors, but uh it was a good experience to be able to play at 16. It's it's just an honor to to be able to put the jersey on, let alone, you know, make a difference and and not a lot of guys made a difference at 16. Obviously Crosby and and Tavvarus did you know a little bit but um you know for the team wise I I don't really know what happened just we had all the talent in the world but just you know never really came together and I think that is a good lesson you know for for the guys who you know are able to to represent Canada again. It's it's all about coming together as one. It's not about being the best team. If you look on paper I don't think Finland was the best team. I would say, you know, they they probably on paper they shouldn't have won, but you know, they were they were a great team and that's that's the main thing. They were a team and and uh you know, they ultimately won. So, you're off to a great start in the uh the 08 your OHL season. I did notice, however, that after three games, you've got two minor penalties already. You were the three three minor penalties. You're you're uh in danger of not winning the sportsmanlike player award. Yeah. Yeah. My dad my dad said uh you know he didn't want the sportsman like so he threw it away early I guess but uh just kind of how it works actually they came in all in one game and it was just uh couple bad balances. One was you know just getting a little angry with with the guy and um it happens I guess but um yeah the sportsmanlike comes again it comes again but if not you know it's it's whatever. You've never had a fight in the OHL. What would it take to make Conor McDavid angry enough to drop his gloves? Uh, I don't know. I don't know. Actually, Joel Wigle just had a fight in in a 7-1 game and broke his hand and and he's done for about three months. So, that kind of said made me say, "H maybe maybe fighting is not my thing." But, um, you know, if maybe if uh, you know, someone took, you know, a good run at, you know, one of the younger guys or was taking a good run at me, then, you know, maybe I have to take exception. Your uh, your family has been very important to you. I I know that your dad coached you through much of your minor hockey. What What's the best lesson that he's ever imparted to you? Uh the best lesson he's probably ever taught me was um you know, he always said that if you have a goal, make each and every day count towards that goal. And you know, I try and do that. I mean, each and every day it's about getting better and and all that. And um you know, he he did a great job instilling, you know, hard work in me and and all that stuff. And um you know I've I own you know everything. Uh your mom Kelly um I would describe her as not a hockey mom. I mean I think she's she told me before that if you if all the kids if you and your brother Cameron had decided to be skiers when they were when you were four or five years old she would have been just as happy and that what what what's your mom mean to you in terms of handling your career? She's probably one of the most important people to be honest. Um, and although she wants to be a skiing family, um, she she does just a great job of keeping the game very secondary. She just makes sure that, you know, all the mom stuff, I'm sleeping right, I'm eating well, taking care of myself, and I'm not getting sick and all that stuff. So, uh, you know, she does a great job. You got a brother, Cameron. He's four years older than you. Um, I know he's very proud of you and you get along very well, but an older brother must have been some times where he's given you the gears pretty good, too. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. We always used to play a road hockey together and for some reason it was always me getting hurt and uh I couple stitches, you know, couple very close calls. Stick came right up here. Almost lost my eye, but uh it was uh you know, he's he's great. I mean, he uh, you know, you think there might be like a little bit of jealousy, you know, with an older brother and his younger brother, you know, gets more attention than him. It's it's and it's not like that. He's he's a great older brother and, you know, he's not doing too bad for himself either. He's, you know, an Ivy student in Western and, uh, you know, he's doing great things there. So, uh, I know that Sydney Crosby's a very superstitious hockey player. On a on a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being Crosby, like superstitious, how superstitious are you? Say probably an eight. An eight or nine. I'm a pretty superstitious guy as well. Um, couple crazy ones that honestly if I told you, you would think I was absolutely insane. Let's hear Let's hear. Honestly, I have no idea. It's just uh You get dressed a certain way every time, correct? Of course. Of course. Get dressed a certain way. Uh, one that I always get the gears for is uh my warm-up shoes. My warm-up shoes have a hole at the top and you know my my toes coming out the top and the whole bottom is just torn right out. But uh you know I I joke they're they're my like mics cuz uh I wear them uh I've worn them since I was I was a little guy. So uh what about uh I I think some of your underwear that you wear too is Yeah. Yeah. Actually, uh there was a pretty bad incident last year before one of the games. You know, I have my uh my lucky underwear and and they get pretty torn and ripped and all that stuff and there was it was before a game and uh Nick Betts just jokingly or whatever and uh you know, we got into a little bit of a wrestle before the game and all of a sudden my boxers just just ripped right in half. Couldn't wear them anymore and I was pretty upset with them for a bit but uh you know I had to find another lucky pair of boxers. We joke about it, but do you ever worry that superstition becomes an impediment that your lucky underwear and you have a bad game because of it that you become a slave to that superstition or can have a negative impact? Of course. Yeah, you can you can often times, you know, get lost and and your superstitions and all that stuff, but I do I do a good job of keeping them, you know, pretty light and and they're not they're not stupid stuff. or kind of just more of a routine I would say and and all that stuff, but um you can get lost in them for sure. How much preparation goes into getting your stick ready for a game? Actually, I am probably the the last guy to to you know, I I don't spend any time out at all. Most guys get there and and the first thing they do is they tape all three sticks. And taping my stick is actually the last thing I do. do, you know, my warm-up, then I I go get my sticks. And I actually just tape the one, the one I'm going to use. I just tape that one. And um, you know, my equipment manager always hates me for it because I'm always the last guy. He's always, you know, breathing down my neck to to get my spares in on time and stuff, but uh, he does a good job of of understanding, you know, my my kind of time period. So, all right. Thanks for doing this, Connor, and good luck this season. Thanks a lot.
	a year ago one of team usa's dress rehearsals for the world junior championship was an exhibition against the under 18 national team one of the stars that night was maddie veneers a strong-willed smooth skating forward who turned 17 barely one month earlier and proved himself against the nation's best in two older age groups for us was just a fun fun day i mean we get discovered the world junior team it's pretty exciting for us we didn't really expect much out of that game i think we just kind of went out there to work hard you know he's going to be a high draft pick coming up this year but most importantly he really fits this tournament well because it's a speed tournament he's got a lot of speed in this game maddie veneers has played with that pace and passion since his first days skating on the family's backyard pond in hingham massachusetts and that ranks near and far in the years since i remember saying this kid is why they have sports like hockey and football because he was he was just rough and tumble and you know big smile on his face every time he was doing that you know and you you didn't want to be stuck in a house with him christine and bob met as undergraduates at cornell where bob played football after christine earned an engineering degree broadway was her next stop not to watch shows but perform in them so you can imagine how christine and bob reacted when mattie told them he wanted to leave home at age 15 and joined the u.s national team development program christine an attorney moved to michigan with maddie and continued working remotely while bob who works in electronic sales remained in hingham you certainly want to give them every opportunity and not stand in the way the sacrifices have been worthwhile maddie could be the first american chosen in the 2021 nhl entry draft but not everything went according to plan amid the turbulence of 2020. veneers had planned to attend harvard 20 miles from the family's home but as the ivy league moved toward the eventual cancellation of winter sports due to the kobit 19 pandemic maddie looked for another option to play he found one in ann arbor thanks to an assistant coach on this year's world junior staff chris mayott reached out to us and and asked if we'd be interested and so that's we had a relationship with chris when he was at providence so we felt very comfortable with them i think we had known probably four or five years in and out of hockey race so we we jumped at the opportunity kind of fell on michigan and they kind of had everything i wanted they have the academics and the hockey and they were going to play and we have been able to play which which has been great so uh i kind of made that move and it's just been a really great experience so far michigan i tell them whenever we talk about these things like every hockey game that you play this year is a gift and i think it'll really make him appreciate every opportunity that he has to do that throughout this year and probably beyond maddie has enrolled in pre-med classes at michigan an ambitious path but perhaps not surprising for someone whose mother applied to law school while performing in a chorus line on broadway theater remains a major part of christine's life as a performer and instructor and yes she taught musical theater to her children gianna bobby and maddie i wasn't like the sound of music it's like a little bowl and i did some like jersey boys some scenes from the jersey boys so have you ever done any singing for your teammates very minimal we need some more sourcing on that one when he got to the usa camp there one of their first few meetings because coach appert he said he asked everybody to stand up and tell the team something about you that no one knows and maddie told everybody he he could sing and uh so coach africa made him sing on the spot and uh we all laugh about it now and he was telling us afterwards and i said why would you tell him you know i don't know being honest and then he made him sing in front of the whole team so yeah yeah mum was very happy yeah no he loves he loves to sing did you know what he's saying what his go-to song was when coach alford asked him to sing i think it was probably the jersey boys uh probably oh my gosh yeah it's on the wow you
Connor McDavid	hey con how are you in guys are we ready for Mr Char good luck Dylan how you doing jack nice to meet you jack right here Perfect The seat's Hot or Not a goal Jack wi it in overtime I think the combination of my speed and my size um and then just I think I'm a really competitive player uh really like the wins so I think those are my CHS David has a chance in front look at that move oh baby I played you know pretty well I thought I needed to certainly be a lot better in the ASA series um but um the ASA is an unbelievable team and they kind of just sat back and played very solid defense and um we kind of just uh they played well against us D Cole with thei D Cole tow Dr stop they score it was 1-1 with six minutes left seven minutes left and in game one and two and they scored and then all of a sudden our whole team including myself was trying to press and score because we know how go how hard goals are to come by and we're pressing and pressing and before you know it's 4-1 51 I think throughout the year I I kind of learned to block out what everyone else is saying and and worry about what my you know my family thinks of me what my teammates think of me mar cuts the M scores think I need to get my strength I think you know I got to make my first three steps more explosive and uh you know separate faster from the opponent hon now going deep he's got the game's L goal he sets up another one here score terrific passing what was your best game last year I would say against beu at Buu we won 5-2 I was matched up against eel's line he didn't do anything that line didn't do anything we shut him down think what uh what would you do if we wouldn't play hockey I've never thought about that no [Music] never
Connor McDavid	Patrick came to this. He met Snoop Dogg. Are you Is there something you're looking forward to? Uh I don't know. I mean, uh just looking forward to being around it. I mean, uh it's obviously really exciting to be here. Um I don't know. It's just exciting to be here and be around the guys, I guess, and enjoy this experience. It's kind of cool to be around the Stanley Cup, though. Of course. It's kind of hockey versus just Of course. Yeah. I mean, uh, I've never never seen a live Stanley Cup game, so I'm certainly excited for that. Um, obviously this kind of gives you the behind thes scenes look at, you know, what they're what they're doing to get ready and all that kind of stuff. So, um, I just try and uh, soak it all in. Does your mind start to wander and think whether it's next year or the year after that this could be you playing in uh, a playoffs or Stanley Cup final down the road? Um, I don't know. I mean, just that's a little bit far down the road. I mean, I'm just looking forward to the draft and hoping uh obviously uh can can get drafted and um I just hope to play at at some point some. Who are you most looking forward to seeing live at the game? Uh it's pretty hard to pick in a game like this. I mean, you look at the guys, the long list of talent, whether it's uh Patrick Kane, Steven Stamco, Tyler Johnson, Taves, I mean it uh the list goes on and on. So, I'm just excited to see some uh great hockey and obviously I've been watching it on TV and uh looking forward to seeing what it's like live. You ever met any of those guys like Patrick or Steven? Uh I know uh Stam Coach just a bit through uh working out and uh we work out at the same gym, so I know him a bit through that, but um I've never really met any other guys. Do you have any from Sweden, so it's a corny question, but if you had any Swedish favorite players Uh Matt Sundine, I think just being a a Toronto guy. Um you know, he's kind of a guy that I looked up to obviously being from Toronto and and watched him every Saturday night and uh you know, he's unbelievably did everything right and uh just seemed like a great player. How much of a whirlwind has it been the last four or five weeks from the lottery to the final to the CHL awards and now this? Yeah, it's been crazy. It's been a very busy uh couple of weeks and um but it's exciting. It's where you want to be. It's a position that uh every guy wants to be in and I'm very lucky to to be in that position and uh just looking forward to the next couple of weeks and uh you know ultimately get into the draft. So, what does the rest of your summer probably look like? Cuz I imagine you're looking to step into the NHL this season. Yeah, I mean uh just a lot of training obviously. Um just trying to get bigger, stronger, faster, all that kind of stuff. So, you know, a big summer ahead of me and I need to get uh like I said, got to do all those things. Is it a realistic expectation for yourself that you can not only just step into the NHL, but start to make an impact or what do you think that growing or that learning curve is going to be like? I think uh there's going to be some growing pains for sure. I mean, I don't expect to step right in and uh you know, be uh be that guy, I guess. I mean, um you know, it's a it's a much different league. It's it's going to be a lot harder. So, I'm just looking to do what I can in terms of, uh, you know, getting better and working hard this summer and, um, come in and, uh, try and, uh, you know, make the team if I'm lucky. And, um, if, uh, if that happens, then I guess we'll see what happens from there. What was your interactions? What were your interactions like with the Oilers at the combine last week and getting to know those guys a little bit? Yeah, it was it was fine. I mean, uh, went well. I mean, it was a nice meeting and I know it was cool to get to talk to the guys and see all the guys and um just kind of get to talk to them and and meet them a bit more. Was it the evolution of sinking in that this is actually happening? Moments that you just kind of this is real. This is your Yeah, I mean it's it's a dream come true like I said. I mean, last week is the combine and um you know, I remember looking back last year just wishing I could be a part of that and um you know, and now all this is happening now and um you know, it's been a whirlwind and um you know, like I said, it's been a dream come true. So, I'm just trying to enjoy the experience and really looking forward to the draft there and couple of weeks. You said you hadn't met Jack at all. Has the last week or maybe this kind of trip changed that get to know him a little bit? Yeah. Yeah, for sure. I mean, I met him uh at the combine and kind of hung around and uh you know, obviously uh you know, this trip, we're a little bit closer. So, um it's been good chance to get to know him. How much have you kind of studied or looked at the the Oilers roster and just maybe even kind of imagine that I might fit in with this guy or um not too much to be honest. I mean, um I'm not drafted there or anything like that. So, um, I guess I'll do that a little bit more if, uh, if that's where I'm drafted. Have you had any if Jordan or, uh, Taylor, I know they reached out to you right after the box lottery. Have they Have you had any other? Uh, no, not really. But, uh, Teddy Pcell actually works out at, uh, Gary's gym and, uh, same with Derek Roy. So, I kind of see them around a bit. You think that'll if you do go to anything, you think that'll help having guys that went first overall as well? obviously in the same position. Uh yeah, I think so. I mean, uh they've been through it. They understand the position. So, I mean, whatever advice they have, uh you know, will obviously help.
	well unfortunately gage consaleevs uh we talked about him a few weeks ago of mission did not make the cut but one bc player who could be on next year's canadian team is port moody's kent johnson he played for the trail smoke eaters and this year is with michigan university where he's already considered a top prospect for the 2021 draft especially when he scores highlight reel goals looks like michigan will be going on the power play johnson stick handling his way in oh what a goal gorgeous goal ken johnson how are you doing kent johnson is doing just great thank you very much johnson is picking up in the ncaa where he left off last year with trail smoke heaters of the bc hockey league where he fired 52 goals and 103 points to lead the league in scoring they don't give out style points in hockey but johnson has made a habit of scoring spectacular goals ken johnson to the backhand johnson scores i just don't really think about failure and uh if i try something it doesn't work that's okay i'll just figure out how i can work next time so um yeah i just don't really think too much when playing just let my stub punches do the work kent does things with the puck that not a lot of people can do he is his edge work is is nhl elite quality and you can't say that about a lot of players and that's the one of the gifts he has is he has a creative mind again great skills with the puck great skills with his feet so the ceiling is very high on him jeff tambellini was johnson's coach in trail so he got a close-up view of his exceptional talent but like all the great ones that talent is accompanied by a voracious appetite to succeed he got to this point where we'd have to almost kick him off the ice because he would stay out there all day but you look at his talent the way he handles the puck you don't get to that level if you haven't spent hours on hours working at your craft tambellini's been an important mentor for johnson both are from port moody and when jeff took over his head coaching trail two years ago the first guy he recruited was johnson and tambellini made it clear right away he wasn't going to stifle any of that creativity and he really helped me develop and just let me make mistakes out there and i think that's huge for me you got to make mistakes to get better so i was never playing playing nervous or worried about making a mistake and i think that really helped my offensive game and johnson continues to flourish in the ncaa where he's fifth in the entire country in scoring with two goals and eight assists in his first 10 games he's got everyone's attention including central scouting where he's already projected to be a high first round pick in the 2021 nhl entry draft definitely a cool position to be in and one that i think a lot of kids would like to be in so i just don't take it for granted he's probably going to push to go in the top five he's doing some very special things he's probably the most creative player in the entire draft and it's up to him to have a great finish this season but he's put himself in a very good position as of today yeah that guy's got some mad skills skills with a zed
